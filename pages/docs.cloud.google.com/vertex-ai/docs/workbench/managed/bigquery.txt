Query data in BigQuery from within JupyterLab
Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks is
deprecated
. On
    April 14, 2025, support for
    managed notebooks ended and the ability to create managed notebooks instances
    was removed. Existing instances will continue to function until
    March 30, 2026, but patches, updates, and upgrades
    won't be available. To continue using Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you
migrate
    your managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances
.
This page shows you how to query data that is stored
in BigQuery from within the JupyterLab interface
of your Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks instance.
Methods for querying BigQuery data in notebook (IPYNB) files
To query BigQuery data from within a JupyterLab notebook file,
you can use the
%%bigquery
magic command and
the BigQuery client library for Python.
Managed notebooks instances also
include a BigQuery integration that lets you
browse and query data from within the JupyterLab interface.
This page describes how to use each of these methods.
Open JupyterLab
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Managed notebooks
page.
Go to Managed notebooks
Next to your managed notebooks instance's name,
click
Open JupyterLab
.
Your managed notebooks instance opens JupyterLab.
Browse BigQuery resources
The BigQuery integration provides a pane for browsing
the BigQuery resources that you have access to.
In the JupyterLab navigation menu, click
BigQuery in Notebooks
.
The
BigQuery
pane lists available projects and datasets, where you
can perform tasks as follows:
To view a description of a dataset, double-click the dataset name.
To show a dataset's tables, views, and models, expand the dataset.
To open a summary description as a tab in JupyterLab, double-click a
table, view, or model.
Note:
On the summary description for a table, click the
Preview
tab to preview a table's data. The following image shows a preview of the
international_top_terms
table
found in the
google_trends
dataset in the
bigquery-public-data
project:
Query data by using the %%bigquery magic command
In this section, you write SQL directly in notebook cells and read data from
BigQuery into the Python notebook.
Magic commands that use a single or double percentage character (
%
or
%%
)
let you use minimal syntax to interact with BigQuery within the
notebook. The BigQuery client library for Python is automatically
installed in a managed notebooks instance. Behind the scenes, the
%%bigquery
magic
command uses the BigQuery client library for Python to run the
given query, convert the results to a pandas DataFrame, optionally save the
results to a variable, and then display the results.
Note
: As of version 1.26.0 of the
google-cloud-bigquery
Python package,
the
BigQuery Storage API
is used by default to download results from the
%%bigquery
magics.
To open a notebook file, select
File
>
New
>
Notebook
.
In the
Select Kernel
dialog, select
Python (Local)
, and then click
Select
.
Your new IPYNB file opens.
To get the number of regions by country in the
international_top_terms
dataset, enter the following statement:
%%
bigquery
SELECT
country_code
,
country_name
,
COUNT
(
DISTINCT
region_code
)
AS
num_regions
FROM
`
bigquery

1
DAY
)
GROUP
BY
country_code
,
country_name
ORDER
BY
num_regions
DESC
;
Click
play_circle_filled
Run cell
.
The output is similar to the following:

Note:
Your results might differ from what is above as the
google_trends
dataset being queried is refreshed with new data on an ongoing basis.
In the next cell (below the output from the previous cell), enter the
following command to run the same query, but this time save the results to
a new pandas DataFrame that's named
regions_by_country
. You provide that
name by using an argument with the
%%bigquery
magic command.
%%
bigquery
regions_by_country

Note:
For more information about available arguments for the
%%bigquery
command, see the
client library magics documentation
.

In the next cell, enter the following command to look at the first few
rows of the query results that you just read in:
regions_by_country
.
head
()
Click
play_circle_filled
Run cell
.
The pandas DataFrame
regions_by_country
is ready to plot.
Query data by using the BigQuery client library directly
In this section, you use the BigQuery client library for Python
directly to read data into the Python notebook.
The client library gives you more control over your queries and lets you use
more complex configurations for queries and jobs. The library's integrations
with pandas enable you to combine the power of declarative SQL with imperative
code (Python) to help you analyze, visualize, and transform your data.
Note:
You can use a number of Python data analysis, data wrangling, and
visualization libraries, such as
numpy
,
pandas
,
matplotlib
, and many
others. Several of these libraries are built on top of a DataFrame object.
In the next cell, enter the following Python code to import the
BigQuery client library for Python and initialize a client:
from
google.cloud
import
bigquery
client
=
bigquery
.
Client
()
The BigQuery client is used to send and receive messages
from the BigQuery API.
Click
play_circle_filled
Run cell
.
In the next cell, enter the following code to retrieve the percentage of
daily top terms in the US
top_terms
that overlap across time by number of days apart. The idea here is to look
at each day's top terms and see what percentage of them overlap with the
top terms from the day before, 2 days prior, 3 days prior, and so on (for
all pairs of dates over about a month span).

Note:
Your results might differ from what is above as the
google_trends
dataset being queried is refreshed with new data on an ongoing basis.

Query data by using the BigQuery integration in managed notebooks
The BigQuery integration provides two additional methods
for querying data. These methods are different from using
the
%%bigquery
magic command.
The
In-cell query editor
is a cell type that you can use within
your notebook files.
The
Stand-alone query editor
opens as a separate tab in JupyterLab.
In-cell
To use the in-cell query editor to query data
in a BigQuery table, complete the following steps:
In JupyterLab, open a notebook (IPYNB) file or
create a
new one
.
To create an in-cell query editor, click the cell,
and then to the right of the cell, click the
BigQuery Integration
button.
Or in a markdown cell, enter
#@BigQuery
.
The BigQuery integration converts the cell into
an in-cell query editor.
On a new line below
#@BigQuery
, write your query using
the
supported statements and SQL dialects of
BigQuery
.
If errors are detected in your query, an error message appears
in the top right corner of the query editor. If the query is valid,
the estimated number of bytes to be processed appears.
Click
Submit Query
. Your query results appear.
By default, query results are paginated at 100 rows per page
and limited to 1,000 rows total, but you can change
these settings at the bottom of the results table. In the
query editor, keep the query limited to only the data you need
to verify your query. You'll run this query again in a notebook cell,
where you can adjust the limit to retrieve the
full results set if you want.
Note:
Query text and results persist after closing and reopening
the notebook file.
You can click
Query and load as DataFrame
to automatically
add a new cell that contains a code segment
that imports the BigQuery client library for Python,
runs your query in a notebook cell, and stores the results
in a pandas dataframe named
df
.
Stand-alone
To use the stand-alone query editor to query data
in a BigQuery table, complete the following steps:
In JupyterLab, in the
BigQuery in Notebooks
pane, right-click
a table, and select
Query table
,
or double-click a table to open a description
in a separate tab, and then click the
Query table
link.
Write your query using the
supported statements and SQL dialects of
BigQuery
.
If errors are detected in your query, an error message appears
in the top right corner of the query editor. If the query is valid,
the estimated number of bytes to be processed appears.
Click
Submit Query
. Your query results appear.
By default, query results are paginated at 100 rows per page
and limited to 1,000 rows total, but you can change
these settings at the bottom of the results table. In the
query editor, keep the query limited to only the data you need
to verify your query. You'll run this query again in a notebook cell,
where you can adjust the limit to retrieve the
full results set if you want.
You can click
Copy code for DataFrame
to copy a code segment
that imports the BigQuery client library for Python,
runs your query in a notebook cell, and stores the results
in a pandas dataframe named
df
. Paste this code into a notebook cell
where you want to run it.
View query history and reuse queries
To view your query history as a tab in JupyterLab, perform the following steps:
In the JupyterLab navigation menu, click
BigQuery in Notebooks
to open the
BigQuery
pane.
In the
BigQuery
pane, scroll down and click
Query history
.
A list of your queries opens in a new tab, where you can perform tasks such
as the following:
To view the details of a query such as its Job ID, when the query was
run, and how long it took, click the query.
To revise the query, run it again, or copy it into your notebook for
future use, click
Open query in editor
.
Note:
If you run queries after opening this tab, click
refresh
Refresh
to show
the most recent queries.
