Introduction to managed notebooks
Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks is
deprecated
. On
    April 14, 2025, support for
    managed notebooks ended and the ability to create managed notebooks instances
    was removed. Existing instances will continue to function until
    March 30, 2026, but patches, updates, and upgrades
    won't be available. To continue using Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you
migrate
    your managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances
.
Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks instances
are Google-managed environments
with integrations and capabilities that help you set up and work in
an end-to-end Jupyter notebook-based production environment.
Managed notebooks instances are prepackaged with
JupyterLab
and have a preinstalled suite of deep learning packages,
including support for the TensorFlow and PyTorch
frameworks. Managed notebooks instances support GPU accelerators and
the ability to sync with a
GitHub
repository.
Your managed notebooks instances are protected
by Google Cloud authentication and authorization.
Google-managed compute infrastructure
A Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks instance
is a Google-managed, Jupyter notebook-based, compute infrastructure.
When you create a managed notebooks instance,
it is deployed as a Google-managed virtual machine (VM) instance in a
tenant project
.
Your managed notebooks instance includes many common
data science framework environments, such as TensorFlow
and PyTorch. You can also add your own custom container images to
your managed notebooks instance. These environments
are available as kernels that you can run your
notebook file in.
When you run a notebook in one of the kernels, Vertex AI Workbench
starts the corresponding container, creates a Jupyter session on it, and
uses that Jupyter session to run your notebook on the container.
This Google-managed compute infrastructure includes integrations
and capabilities that help you implement data science and machine learning
workflows from start to finish. See the following sections for details.
Use custom containers
You can add custom Docker container images to
your managed notebooks instance
to run your notebook code in an environment customized for your needs.
These custom containers are available to use directly from the
JupyterLab user interface, alongside the preinstalled frameworks.
For more information, see
Add a custom container to
a managed notebooks instance
.
Notebook-based workflow
Managed notebooks instances let you
perform workflow-oriented tasks without leaving the JupyterLab user interface.
Control your hardware and framework from JupyterLab
In a managed notebooks instance, your JupyterLab user interface
is where you specify what compute resources your code will run on. For example,
you can configure how many vCPUs or GPUs you want, how much RAM you want, and
what framework you want to run the code in. You can write your code first, and
then choose how to run it without leaving JupyterLab
or restarting your instance.
For quick tests of your code, you can scale your hardware down and then scale it
back up to run your code against more data.
Access to data
You can access your data without leaving the JupyterLab user interface.
In JupyterLab's navigation menu on
a managed notebooks instance, you can use the
Cloud Storage integration
to browse data and other files that you have access to.
See
Access Cloud Storage buckets and files
from within JupyterLab
.
You can also use the
BigQuery integration
to browse tables that you have access to,
write queries, preview results, and load data into your notebook.
See
Query data in BigQuery tables
from within JupyterLab
.
Execute notebook runs
Use the executor to run a notebook file
as a one-time execution or on a schedule.
Choose the specific environment and hardware that you want
your execution to run on. Your notebook's code will run on
Vertex AI custom training, which can make it easier
to do distributed training, optimize hyperparameters, or
schedule continuous training jobs. See
Run notebook files
with the executor
.
You can
use parameters in
your execution
to make specific changes to each run.
For example, you might specify a different dataset to use,
change the learning rate on your model, or change the version
of the model.
You can also
set a notebook to run on a recurring
schedule
.
Even while your instance is shut down, Vertex AI Workbench will
run your notebook file and save the results
for you to look at and share with others.
Share insights
Executed notebook runs are stored in a Cloud Storage bucket,
so you can share your insights with others by granting access
to the results. See the
previous section on executing
notebook runs
.
Secure your instance
You can deploy your managed notebooks instance
with the default Google-managed network,
which uses a default VPC network and subnet.
Instead of the default network, you can specify a
VPC network to use with your instance.
For more information, see
Set up a network
. You can use
VPC Service Controls
to provide additional security for your
managed notebooks instances.
To use managed notebooks within a service perimeter, see
Use
a managed notebooks instance within a service
perimeter
.
By default, Google Cloud automatically
encrypts data when it is at
rest
using encryption keys managed by Google. If you have specific compliance or
regulatory requirements related to the keys that protect your data, you can
use customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) with
your managed notebooks instances. For more information,
see
Use customer-managed encryption keys
.
Automated shutdown for idle instances
To help manage costs,
managed notebooks instances
shut down after being idle for a specific time period by default.
You can change the amount of time or turn this feature off.
For more information,
see
Idle shutdown
.
Dataproc integration
You can process data quickly by running a notebook
on a Dataproc cluster.
After your cluster is set up, you can run
a notebook file on it without leaving the JupyterLab user interface.
For more information, see
Run a managed notebooks instance
on a Dataproc cluster
.
Limitations
Consider the following limitations of
managed notebooks when planning your project:
Managed notebooks instances are Google-managed
and therefore less customizable than Vertex AI Workbench
user-managed notebooks instances.
User-managed notebooks instances can be
more ideal for users who need a lot of control over their environment.
For more information, see
Introduction to
user-managed notebooks
.
Third party JupyterLab extensions are not supported.
The Dataproc JupyterLab plugin isn't supported for
managed notebooks, but you can use the plugin in
Vertex AI Workbench instances. See
Create a
Dataproc-enabled
instance
.
Managed notebooks instances do not allow users to
have
sudo
access.
When you use
Access Context Manager
and
Chrome Enterprise Premium
to protect managed notebooks instances with
context-aware access controls, access is evaluated each time
the user authenticates to the instance. For example, access
is evaluated the first time the user accesses JupyterLab and
whenever they access it thereafter if their web browser's
cookie has expired.
To use accelerators with managed notebooks instances,
the accelerator type that you want must be available in your instance's
zone. To learn about accelerator availability by zone, see
GPU regions and zones availability
.

networking options available for your
