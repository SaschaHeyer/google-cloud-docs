Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks is
deprecated
. On
    April 14, 2025, support for
    managed notebooks ended and the ability to create managed notebooks instances
    was removed. Existing instances will continue to function until
    March 30, 2026, but patches, updates, and upgrades
    won't be available. To continue using Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you
migrate
    your managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances
.
By default, Vertex AI Workbench encrypts customer content at
    rest. Vertex AI Workbench handles encryption for you without any
  additional actions on your part. This option is called
Google default encryption
.
If you want to control your encryption keys, then you can use customer-managed encryption keys
  (CMEKs) in
Cloud KMS
with CMEK-integrated services including
  Vertex AI Workbench. Using Cloud KMS keys gives you control over their protection
  level, location, rotation schedule, usage and access permissions, and cryptographic boundaries.
  Using Cloud KMS also lets
you view audit logs and control key lifecycles.
  
  Instead of Google owning and managing the symmetric
key encryption keys (KEKs)
that protect your data, you control and
  manage these keys in Cloud KMS.
After you set up your resources with CMEKs, the experience of accessing your
  Vertex AI Workbench resources is similar to using Google default encryption.
  For more information about your encryption
  options, see
Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)
.
This page describes some specific benefits and limitations of using CMEK with
managed notebooks and shows
how to configure a new managed notebooks instance
to use CMEK.
Benefits of CMEK
In general, CMEK is most useful if you need full control over the keys used to
encrypt your data. With CMEK, you can manage your keys within
Cloud Key Management Service. For example, you can rotate or disable a key or you can set
up a rotation schedule by using the Cloud KMS API.
When you run a managed notebooks instance,
your instance runs in a compute infrastructure managed by Google.
When you enable
CMEK for a managed notebooks instance,
Vertex AI Workbench uses the key that you designate,
rather than a key managed by Google, to encrypt your user data.
The CMEK key
doesn't
encrypt metadata, like the instance's name and region,
associated with your managed notebooks instance.
Metadata associated with
managed notebooks instances is always
encrypted using Google's default encryption mechanism.
Limitations of CMEK
To decrease latency and to prevent cases where resources depend on
services that are spread across multiple failure domains, Google recommends
that you protect regional
managed notebooks instances with keys in the same location.
You can encrypt regional managed notebooks instances
by using keys in the same location or in the global location. For example,
you can encrypt user data in region
us-west1
by using
a key in
us-west1
or
global
.
Configuring CMEK for
managed notebooks
doesn't
automatically configure CMEK
for other Google Cloud products that you use. To use CMEK to encrypt
data in other Google Cloud products, you must complete additional
configuration.
Configure CMEK for your managed notebooks instance
The following sections describe how to create a
key ring and key in Cloud Key Management Service,
grant the service account encrypter and decrypter permissions for your key,
and create a managed notebooks instance that uses CMEK.
Before you begin
We recommend using a setup that supports a
separation of
duties
. To configure CMEK
for managed notebooks, you can use
two separate Google Cloud projects:
A Cloud KMS project: a project for managing your encryption key
A managed notebooks project: a project for accessing
managed notebooks instances and interacting with any
other Google Cloud products that you need for your use case
Alternatively, you can use a single Google Cloud project. To do so,
use the same project for all of the following tasks.
Set up the Cloud KMS project
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
        Google Cloud,
create an account
to evaluate how our products perform in
        real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
        run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
        select or create a Google Cloud project.

Set up the Google Cloud CLI
The gcloud CLI is required for some steps on this page and optional
for others.
Install
the Google Cloud CLI.
        
          After installation,
initialize
the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud
init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity
.
Note:
You can run the gcloud CLI in
      the Google Cloud console without installing the Google Cloud CLI. To run the
      gcloud CLI in the Google Cloud console,
use
        Cloud Shell
.
Create a key ring and key
When you create a key ring and key, keep the following requirements in mind:
When you choose your key ring's location, use either
global
or the location where your managed notebooks instance
will be.
Make sure to create your key ring and key in your Cloud KMS project.
To create a key ring and a key, see
Create symmetric encryption keys
.
Grant managed notebooks permissions
If you set up your instance with
single user
access
,
you must grant your managed notebooks instance's project
permission to encrypt and decrypt data using your key.
You grant this permission to your project's
service agent
.
This service agent's email address looks like:
service
-
NOTEBOOKS_PROJECT_NUMBER
@gcp
-
sa
-
notebooks
.
iam.gserviceaccount.com
Replace
NOTEBOOKS_PROJECT_NUMBER
with the
project number
for your managed notebooks instance's project.
Make note of the email address for your service agent.
You will use it in the following steps to grant your
managed notebooks instance's project permission
to encrypt and decrypt data using your key.
You can grant permission by using the Google Cloud console or
by using the Google Cloud CLI.
Note:
If you set up your instance with
service account
      access
,
      you don't need to grant any further permissions.
