Migrate from managed notebooks to Vertex AI Workbench instances
Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks is
deprecated
.
    On April 14, 2025, support for managed notebooks
    will end and the ability to create managed notebooks instances
    will be removed. Existing instances will continue to function
    but patches, updates, and upgrades won't be available. To continue using
    Vertex AI Workbench, complete the steps on this page to
migrate
    your managed notebooks instances to
    Vertex AI Workbench instances
.
This page describes how to migrate from
a managed notebooks instance to a Vertex AI Workbench instance.
You can migrate by using the Vertex AI Workbench migration tool or
migrate your instance's data and files manually.
Overview of the migration tool
Vertex AI Workbench provides a migration tool for migrating from
a managed notebooks instance to a Vertex AI Workbench instance.
The migration tool creates a Vertex AI Workbench instance with a
configuration similar to the managed notebooks instance
that you want to migrate. For example,
the migration tool creates an instance that has the same or similar
machine type, network configuration, idle shutdown settings,
and other specifications. Then, the files on your
managed notebooks instance's data disk are copied to the
Vertex AI Workbench instance.
Vertex AI Workbench doesn't delete or change your
managed notebooks instance, so after migration you can continue
to use it. If you don't need the managed notebooks instance
anymore,
delete it
to avoid further charges for that instance.
Billing
If your managed notebooks instance uses Extreme Persistent Disks,
then your migration generates charges for I/O operations. See "Extreme
provisioned IOPS" in the
Persistent Disk and Hyperdisk pricing section of
Disk pricing
.
After migration, the managed notebooks instance still exists
and generates charges as before. If you don't need
the managed notebooks instance
anymore,
delete it
to avoid further charges for that instance.
Default migration tool behaviors
The Vertex AI Workbench migration tool attempts to
migrate your managed notebooks instance to
a Vertex AI Workbench instance with matching specifications.
When a specification in your managed notebooks instance isn't
available in Vertex AI Workbench instances, Vertex AI Workbench
uses a default specification when possible. When the migration tool
can't migrate a specification of your managed notebooks instance,
it doesn't migrate the instance.
The following table lists some of the key default migration behaviors
for the migration tool.

Identity and Access Management permissions
Migrated, though new permissions might be required to use
        the Vertex AI Workbench instance
Access mode
Migrated; instances that use the single user JupyterLab access mode must
specify the
serviceAccount
option
Network
Migrated; instances that use a Google-managed Virtual Private Cloud must
specify the
network
and
subnet
options
Post-startup script
When using the Google Cloud console, the instance is migrated without
        the post-startup script; to migrate the instance with the
        post-startup script, use the Google Cloud CLI or REST API to
specify the
PostStartupScriptOption
option
Dataproc Hub
Not migrated; must
migrate manually
Specifying options
The following sections describe cases where specifying an option
is required to migrate your managed notebooks instance
to a Vertex AI Workbench instance.
Instances that use the single user access mode
Managed notebooks instances that use the
single user access mode must be migrated to an
instance with the
serviceAccount
option specified.
The Vertex AI Workbench instance that you migrate to restricts
access to JupyterLab to the single user, but it uses a service account
to interact with Google Cloud services and APIs.
Instances that use a Google-managed VPC
Managed notebooks instances that use a Google-managed
VPC must be migrated to an instance with the
network
and
subnet
options specified.
The option to use a Google-managed VPC isn't supported
in Vertex AI Workbench instances, so a different network must be
specified.
Instances that use a post-startup script
Managed notebooks instances that use a post-startup script
must be migrated to an instance with the
PostStartupScriptOption
option specified. Use this option to indicate whether you want to
skip or rerun the post-startup script in your new
Vertex AI Workbench instance.
Specifying the
PostStartupScriptOption
option isn't supported
in the Google Cloud console. To specify the
PostStartupScriptOption
option when you migrate
your managed notebooks instance, you must
use the Google Cloud CLI or REST API.

Check the output for warnings or errors
If migration warnings or errors are detected, the output of
the
projects.locations.runtimes.list
method includes this information.
Warnings appear when specific components in
your managed notebooks instance's configuration won't migrate
to the same specification in a Vertex AI Workbench instance.
For example, if your managed notebooks instance uses an
unsupported accelerator, a warning appears in the output. In this case,
the instance is migrated without any accelerators. You can attach
accelerators after migration. Review the warnings in
the output, consider the
migration tool's default behaviors
,
and assess whether the migration tool is acceptable for your migration.
One or more errors in the output means that you can't migrate
the managed notebooks instance by using the migration tool.
You must
migrate the instance manually
.
For more information about migration warnings and errors, see
warnings
and
errors
in the
RuntimeMigrationEligibility
documentation.

Migrate manually
To migrate your instance to a Vertex AI Workbench instance manually,
consider using the following methods:
Use Cloud Storage and the terminal
: Copy your data and files
to Cloud Storage and then to another instance by using the terminal.
Use GitHub
: Copy your data and files to a GitHub repository
by using the Git extension for JupyterLab.
This guide describes how to migrate data and files by using
Cloud Storage and the terminal.
Requirements
You must have terminal access to your managed notebooks instance.
Terminal access is manually set when you create an instance. The
terminal access setting cannot be changed after the instance is created.
Migrate manually by using Cloud Storage and the terminal
To migrate data and files to a new Vertex AI Workbench instance
by using Cloud Storage and the terminal, do the following.
Create a Cloud Storage bucket
in the same project where your managed notebooks instance
is located.
In that same project,
Create
a Vertex AI Workbench instance
to migrate your data to.
When you create this instance:
Enable terminal access.
Specify the machine type, network,
and other characteristics to match what you need.
In your managed notebooks instance's
JupyterLab interface, select
File
>
New
>
Terminal
to open a terminal window.
Use the
gcloud CLI
to copy your user data
to a Cloud Storage bucket. The following example command
copies all of the files from your instance's
/home/jupyter/
directory
to a directory in a Cloud Storage bucket.
gcloud
storage
cp
/home/jupyter/*
gs://
BUCKET_NAME
PATH
--recursive
Replace the following:
BUCKET_NAME
: The name of your
Cloud Storage bucket
PATH
: The path to the directory
where you want to copy your files, for example:
/copy/jupyter/
In your new Vertex AI Workbench instance's
JupyterLab interface, select
File
>
New
>
Terminal
to open a terminal window.
Use the gcloud CLI to copy your data to the new instance.
The following example command copies all of
the files from a Cloud Storage directory to the
your new instance's
/home/jupyter/
directory.
gcloud
storage
cp
gs://
BUCKET_NAME
PATH
*
/home/jupyter/
--recursive
Confirm the migration
After the migration, the original managed notebooks instance
continues to work as before. Confirm that your migration was a success
before you delete the original instance.
Delete the managed notebooks instance
If you don't need the managed notebooks instance that
you migrated from, delete it to avoid further charges for that instance.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Managed notebooks
page.
Go to Managed notebooks
Select the instance that you want to delete.
Click
delete
Delete
.
(Depending on the size of your window,
the
Delete
button might be in
the
more_vert
options menu.)
To confirm, click
Delete
.
