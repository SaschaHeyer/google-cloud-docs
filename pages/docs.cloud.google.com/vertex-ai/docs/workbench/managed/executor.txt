Run notebook files with the executor
Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks is
deprecated
. On
    April 14, 2025, support for
    managed notebooks ended and the ability to create managed notebooks instances
    was removed. Existing instances will continue to function until
    March 30, 2026, but patches, updates, and upgrades
    won't be available. To continue using Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you
migrate
    your managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances
.
This page describes how to use the executor in
a Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks instance to run notebook files
as a one-time execution and on a schedule.
Overview
The executor lets you submit a notebook (ipynb) file to run on
Vertex AI custom training
.
You can set parameter values for each execution of a notebook file.
You can also run a notebook file on a recurring schedule.
After the execution completes, you can view the execution results and
share them with others.
When a notebook file is submitted to Vertex AI custom training,
Vertex AI creates a new custom training job
that executes your notebook file following the
lifecycle of a training
job
.
Requirements for notebook code run by the executor
When you write notebook code to run in the executor, keep in mind
that the code will run in a
tenant project
separate from your managed notebooks instance's project.
This section describes how this affects your code when it is run
in the executor.
Ensure package installations are available to the executor
If your notebook depends on package installations that are not already
included in the managed notebooks kernel that you are using,
make sure your packages are available to your notebook code
in the executor in one of the following ways:
Use a
custom container
that already has the package installed, and then execute your notebook
on that custom container. See the
requirements for using
a custom container with the executor
.
Install the package within your notebook file's code.
The package is installed every time the notebook file is executed,
but this ensures that the package is available on
the container that you select when you execute your notebook.
Use explicit project selection
When you access resources through code run by the executor,
the executor might not connect to the correct
Google Cloud project. If you encounter permission errors,
connecting to the wrong project might be the problem.
This problem occurs because the executor does not run your code
directly in your managed notebooks instance's
Google Cloud project. Instead, the executor
runs your code in Vertex AI custom training
within a tenant project managed by Google.
Therefore, don't try to infer a project ID from the environment in
your notebook code; specify project IDs explicitly.
If you don't want to hardcode a project ID in your code, you can
reference the
CLOUD_ML_PROJECT_ID
environment variable.
Vertex AI
sets this environment variable in every custom training container to contain the
project number
of the project where you initiated
custom training. Many Google Cloud tools can accept a project
number wherever they take a project ID.
For example, if you want to use the
Python Client for Google
BigQuery
to access a
BigQuery table in the same project, then do not infer the
project in your notebook code:
Implicit project selection
from
google.cloud
import
bigquery
client
=
bigquery
.
Client
()
Instead use code that explicitly selects a project:
Explicit project selection
import
os
from
google.cloud
import
bigquery
project_number
=
os
.
environ
[
"CLOUD_ML_PROJECT_ID"
]
client
=
bigquery
.
Client
(
project
=
project_number
)
Authenticate access using service accounts
By default, your managed notebooks instance
can have access to resources that exist in the same project.
Therefore, when you run your notebook file's code manually,
these resources do not need additional authentication. However,
because the executor runs in a separate tenant project, it does not
have the same default access.
Also, the executor cannot use end-user credentials to authenticate access
to resources, for example, the
gcloud auth login
command
.
To resolve these issues, in your notebook file's code,
authenticate access to resources through a service account.
Then when you create an execution or schedule, specify the
service account.
For example, while you
create an execution
,
complete these steps:
In the
Submit notebooks to Executor
dialog,
expand
Advanced options
.
In the
Identity and API access
section,
clear the check mark next to
Use Vertex AI Training's default service account
and enter the specific service account to use.
See the full list of
steps for creating an execution
.
Requirements when using a custom container
You can use the executor to run notebook code on a custom container.
Your custom container must include the
nbexecutor
extension, which
enables the executor to run notebook code as
a Vertex AI custom training job.
To ensure that your custom container has the
nbexecutor
extension,
you can modify one of the
Deep Learning Containers container images to
create a
derivative container image
.
Deep Learning Containers images
include the
nbexecutor
extension.

      IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
      granted a role on.
Create a project
: To create a project, you need the Project Creator
      (
roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create
permission.
Learn how to grant
      roles
.
Note
: If you don't plan to keep the
    resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
    selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
    delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project
.
Enable the Notebooks and Vertex AI APIs.
Roles required to enable APIs

Required roles
To ensure that your instance's service account has the necessary
      permissions to interact with the Vertex AI Workbench executor,
    
      ask your administrator to grant your instance's service account the
    following IAM roles on the project:
Important:
You must grant these roles
      to your instance's service account,
not
to your user account. Failure to grant the roles to the correct principal might result in permission errors.
Notebooks Viewer (
roles/notebooks.viewer
)
Vertex AI User (
roles/aiplatform.user
)
Storage Admin (
roles/storage.admin
)
For more information about granting roles, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations
.
Your administrator might also be able to give your instance's service account
        the required permissions through
custom
        roles
or other
predefined
        roles
.
