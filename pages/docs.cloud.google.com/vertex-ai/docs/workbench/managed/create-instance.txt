        tuning
for detailed instructions for fine-tuning Gemini on
        video data using supervised learning.
AutoML Text
September 15, 2024
June 15, 2025
Starting on September 15, 2024, you can only customize Text
        classification, entity extraction, and sentiment analysis objectives by
        moving to Vertex AI Gemini prompts and tuning. Training or
        updating models for Vertex AI AutoML for
        Text classification, entity extraction, and sentiment analysis
        objectives will no longer be available. You can continue using
        existing Vertex AI AutoML Text models until
        June 15, 2025. For more information about how Gemini offers enhanced
        user experience through improved prompting capabilities, see

        features, simplify end-to-end journeys, and productionize models
        with MLOps.
Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks
January 16, 2024
April 14, 2025
On April 14, 2025, support for
          managed notebooks ended, and the ability to create
          managed notebooks instances was removed. Existing instances will
          continue to function until
          March 30, 2026, but patches,
          updates, and upgrades won't be available.
On March 30, 2026, all
          managed notebooks instances and their associated data will be
          deleted. There is no recovery of managed notebooks instances
          after deletion. There isn't a way to convert these instances
          to Compute Engine virtual machines (VMs). To continue using
          Vertex AI Workbench,
migrate
          your managed notebooks instances to
          Vertex AI Workbench instances
before
          March 30, 2026.
Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks
January 16, 2024
April 14, 2025
On April 14, 2025, support for
          user-managed notebooks ended, and the ability to create
          user-managed notebooks instances was removed. Existing instances
          will continue to function until
          March 30, 2026, but patches,
          updates, and upgrades won't be available.
On March 30, 2026, your
          user-managed notebooks instances will be converted to standard
          Compute Engine virtual machines (VMs). You will have full control
          over these VMs, but they won't be supported or available
          through Vertex AI Workbench. You will incur costs for
          these Compute Engine VMs, so we recommend that you delete
          any VMs that you don't plan to use. To continue using
          Vertex AI Workbench,
migrate
          your user-managed notebooks instances to
          Vertex AI Workbench instances
before
          March 30, 2026.
