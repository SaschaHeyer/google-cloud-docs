Explore and visualize data in BigQuery from within JupyterLab
Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks is
deprecated
. On
    April 14, 2025, support for
    managed notebooks ended and the ability to create managed notebooks instances
    was removed. Existing instances will continue to function until
    March 30, 2026, but patches, updates, and upgrades
    won't be available. To continue using Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you
migrate
    your managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances
.
This page shows you some examples of how to explore and visualize data
that is stored in BigQuery from within the JupyterLab interface
of your Vertex AI Workbench managed notebooks instance.
Open JupyterLab
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Managed notebooks
page.
Go to Managed notebooks
Next to your managed notebooks instance's name,
click
Open JupyterLab
.
Your managed notebooks instance opens JupyterLab.
Read data from BigQuery
In the next two sections, you read data from BigQuery
that you will use to visualize later. These steps are identical to those
in
Query data in BigQuery from
within JupyterLab
, so if you've completed
them already, you can skip to
Get a summary of data in a BigQuery table
.
Query data by using the %%bigquery magic command
In this section, you write SQL directly in notebook cells and read data from
BigQuery into the Python notebook.
Magic commands that use a single or double percentage character (
%
or
%%
)
let you use minimal syntax to interact with BigQuery within the
notebook. The BigQuery client library for Python is automatically
installed in a managed notebooks instance. Behind the scenes, the
%%bigquery
magic
command uses the BigQuery client library for Python to run the
given query, convert the results to a pandas DataFrame, optionally save the
results to a variable, and then display the results.
Note
: As of version 1.26.0 of the
google-cloud-bigquery
Python package,
the
BigQuery Storage API
is used by default to download results from the
%%bigquery
magics.
To open a notebook file, select
File
>
New
>
Notebook
.
In the
Select Kernel
dialog, select
Python (Local)
, and then click
Select
.
Your new IPYNB file opens.
To get the number of regions by country in the
international_top_terms
dataset, enter the following statement:
%%
bigquery
SELECT
country_code
,
country_name
,
COUNT
(
DISTINCT
region_code
)
AS
num_regions
FROM
`
bigquery
-

WHERE

DATE_SUB
(

,
INTERVAL
1
DAY
)
GROUP
BY
country_code
,
country_name
ORDER
BY
num_regions
DESC
;
Click
play_circle_filled
Run cell
.
The output is similar to the following:

...
Note:
Your results might differ from what is above as the
google_trends
dataset being queried is refreshed with new data on an ongoing basis.
In the next cell (below the output from the previous cell), enter the
following command to run the same query, but this time save the results to
a new pandas DataFrame that's named
regions_by_country
. You provide that
name by using an argument with the
%%bigquery
magic command.
%%
bigquery
regions_by_country
SELECT
country_code
,
country_name
,
COUNT
(
DISTINCT
region_code
)
AS
num_regions
FROM

GROUP

;
Note:
For more information about available arguments for the
%%bigquery
command, see the
client library magics documentation
.
Click
play_circle_filled
Run cell
.
In the next cell, enter the following command to look at the first few
rows of the query results that you just read in:
regions_by_country
.
head

Click
play_circle_filled
Run cell
.
The pandas DataFrame
regions_by_country
is ready to plot.
Query data by using the BigQuery client library directly
<
Get a summary of data in a BigQuery table
In this section, you use a notebook shortcut to get summary statistics and
visualizations for all fields of a BigQuery table. This can
be a fast way to profile your data before exploring further.
The BigQuery client library provides a magic command,
%bigquery_stats
, that you can call with a specific table name to provide an
overview of the table and detailed statistics on each of the table's
columns.
In the next cell, enter the following code to run that analysis on the US
top_terms
table
:
%bigquery_stats
bigquery
-
public
-
data
.
google_trends
.
top_terms
Click
play_circle_filled
Run cell
.
After running for some time, an image appears with various statistics on
each of the 7 variables in the
top_terms
table. The following image shows
part of some example output:
Note:
Your results might differ from what is above as the
google_trends
dataset being queried is refreshed with new data on an ongoing basis.
Visualize BigQuery data
In this section, you use plotting capabilities to visualize the results from
the queries that you previously ran in your Jupyter notebook.
In the next cell, enter the following code to use the pandas
DataFrame.plot()
method to create a bar chart that visualizes the results
of the query that returns the number of regions by country:
regions_by_country
.
plot
(
kind
=
"bar"
,
x
=
"country_name"
,
y
=
"num_regions"
,
figsize
=
(
15
,
10
))
Click
play_circle_filled
Run cell
.
The chart is similar to the following:
In the next cell, enter the following code to use the pandas
DataFrame.plot()
method to create a scatter plot that visualizes the
results from the query for the percentage of overlap in the top search terms
by days apart:
pct_overlap_terms_by_days_apart.plot(
  kind="scatter",
  x="days_apart",
  y="pct_overlap_terms",
  s=len(pct_overlap_terms_by_days_apart["num_date_pairs"]) * 20,
  figsize=(15, 10)
  )
Click
play_circle_filled
Run cell
.
The chart is similar to the following. The size of each point reflects
the number of date pairs that are that many days apart in the data. For
example, there are more pairs that are 1 day apart than 30 days apart
because the top search terms are surfaced daily over about a month's time.
For more information about data visualization, see the
pandas documentation
