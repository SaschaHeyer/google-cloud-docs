Create a secure user-managed notebooks instance in a VPC network
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks is
deprecated
. On
    April 14, 2025, support for
    user-managed notebooks ended and the ability to create user-managed notebooks instances
    was removed. Existing instances will continue to function until
    March 30, 2026, but patches, updates, and upgrades
    won't be available. To continue using Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you
migrate
    your user-managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances
.
This tutorial is intended for enterprise data scientists, researchers, and
network administrators. It shows how to secure a
user-managed notebooks instance by creating it
in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.
A
VPC network
is a virtual version of
a physical network that is
implemented inside of Google's production network. It is a private network,
with its own private IP addresses, subnets, and network gateways.
In the enterprise, VPC networks are used to protect
data and instances by controlling access to
them from other networks and from the internet.
The VPC network in this tutorial is a standalone network.
However, you can share a VPC network from one project
(called a host project) to other projects in your Google Cloud organization.
To learn more about which type of VPC network to use, see
Single VPC network and Shared VPC
.
Following network security best practices,
the VPC
network in this tutorial uses a combination of
Cloud Router
,
Cloud NAT
, and
Private Google Access
to secure the instance in the following ways:
The user-managed notebooks instance doesn't have an external
IP address.
The instance has outbound internet access through a regional Cloud Router
and Cloud NAT gateway
so that you can install software packages or other dependencies.
Cloud NAT allows outbound connections and the inbound responses to those
connections. It does
not
permit unsolicited inbound requests from the
internet.
The instance uses Private Google Access to reach the external IP addresses
of Google APIs and services.
The tutorial also shows how to do the following:
Create a post-startup script to automatically clone a GitHub repo into the
newly created user-managed notebooks instance.
Use
Cloud Monitoring
to monitor the user-managed notebooks instance.
Use the
Compute Engine
API to start and stop the instance automatically to optimize costs.
Objectives
Create a VPC network and add a subnet that has Private Google Access
enabled.
Create a Cloud Router and Cloud NAT for the VPC network.
Create a user-managed notebooks instance in the subnet, using
a post-startup script that clones the
Google Cloud Generative AI
GitHub repository.
Enable Cloud Monitoring for the instance.
Create a VM instance schedule and attach it to the instance.
Costs
In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:
Cloud NAT
Compute Engine
Cloud Storage
Vertex AI
Virtual Private Cloud
To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage,
      use the
pricing calculator
.
New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a
free trial
.
When you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid
   continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see
Clean up
.
Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console, go to the project selector page.
Go to project selector
Select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project
: Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
      IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
      granted a role on.
Create a project
: To create a project, you need the Project Creator
      (
roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create
permission.
Learn how to grant
      roles
.
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project
.
Open
Cloud Shell
to execute the commands listed
    in this tutorial. Cloud Shell is an interactive shell environment
    for Google Cloud that lets you manage your projects and resources from
    your web browser.
Go to Cloud Shell
In the Cloud Shell, set the current project to your
  Google Cloud project ID and store the same
  project ID into the
projectid
shell variable:
projectid="
PROJECT_ID
"
gcloud
config
set
project
${
projectid
}
Replace
PROJECT_ID
with your project ID. If necessary, you can
  locate your project ID in the Google Cloud console. For more information, see
Find your project ID
.
Enable the IAM, Compute Engine, Notebooks, Cloud Storage, and Vertex AI APIs.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
          role (
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin
), which
          contains the
serviceusage.services.enable
permission.
Learn how to grant
          roles
.
Enable the APIs
Make sure that you have the following role or roles on the project:
          
          roles/compute.networkAdmin,
  roles/compute.securityAdmin, roles/compute.instanceAdmin, roles/notebooks.admin,
  roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin,
  roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin, roles/iam.serviceAccountUser,
  roles/storage.Admin
Check for the roles
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
IAM
page.
Go to IAM
Select the project.
In the
Principal
column, find all rows that identify you or a group that
                you're included in. To learn which groups you're included in, contact your
                administrator.
For all rows that specify or include you, check the
Role
column to see whether
              the list of roles includes the required roles.
Grant the roles
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
IAM
page.
Go to IAM
Select the project.
Click
person_add
Grant access
.
In the
New principals
field, enter your user identifier.
              
              This is typically the email address for a Google Account.
In the
Select a role
list, select a role.
To grant additional roles, click
add
Add
              another role
and add each additional role.
Click
Save
.
Create and configure a standalone VPC
Create a VPC network named
securevertex-vpc
:
gcloud compute networks create securevertex-vpc --subnet-mode=custom
Create a subnet named
securevertex-subnet-a
, with a primary IPv4 range of
10.10.10.0/29
:

Create a Cloud Storage bucket
Create the Cloud Storage bucket:
gcloud storage buckets create --location=us-central1 --uniform-bucket-level-access gs://
BUCKET_NAME
Replace
BUCKET_NAME
with a unique bucket name.
Set the
BUCKET_NAME
shell variable and verify that it was
entered correctly:
BUCKET_NAME=
BUCKET_NAME
echo $BUCKET_NAME
Replace
BUCKET_NAME
with the bucket name.
Create and upload a post-startup script
To create the script, use a text editor such as
vi
or
nano
to create a file named
poststartup.sh
.
Paste the following shell script into the file:
#! /bin/bash
echo
"Current user: id"
>>
/tmp/notebook_config.log
2>&1
echo
"Changing dir to /home/jupyter"
>>
/tmp/notebook_config.log
2>&1
cd

-c
"git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai.git"
>>
/tmp/notebook_config.log
2>&1
echo
"Current user: id"
>>
/tmp/notebook_config.log
2>&1
echo
"Installing python packages"
>>
/tmp/notebook_config.log
2&1
su
-
jupyter
-c
"pip install --upgrade --no-warn-conflicts --no-warn-script-location --user \
google-cloud-bigquery \
google-cloud-pipeline-components \
google-cloud-aiplatform \
seaborn \
kfp"
>>
/tmp/notebook_config.log
2>&1
Save the file.
Upload the file to your Cloud Storage bucket:
gcloud storage cp poststartup.sh gs://$BUCKET_NAME
Create a custom service account
When you create a user-managed notebooks instance, we strongly
recommend that you clear the
Use Compute Engine default service account
checkbox and specify a custom service account. If your organization doesn't
enforce the
iam.automaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts
organization policy constraint, the Compute Engine default service account
(and thus anyone you specify as an instance user) is granted the Editor role
(
roles/editor
) on your project. To turn off this behavior,
see
Disable automatic role grants to default service
accounts
.
Create a custom service account named
user-managed-notebook-sa
:
gcloud iam service-accounts create user-managed-notebook-sa \
--display-name="user-managed-notebook-sa"
Assign the Storage Object Viewer IAM role to the service
account:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $projectid --member="serviceAccount:user-managed-notebook-sa@$projectid.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/storage.objectViewer"
Assign the Vertex AI User IAM role to the service
account:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $projectid --member="serviceAccount:user-managed-notebook-sa@$projectid.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/aiplatform.user"
Create a user-managed notebooks instance

IAM and security
: To grant a single user access to the instance's
JupyterLab interface, complete the following steps:
Select
Single user
.
In the
User email
field, enter the email address for a single
user account. If you're creating the instance for someone else,
the following conditions apply:
You (the instance creator) don't have access to the instance's
JupyterLab interface. But you still control the instance, and
you can start, stop, or delete it.
After you create the instance, you need to grant the user the
Service Account User role
(
roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
) on the instance's service
account. See
Optional: Grant the Service Account User role to the instance user
.
Clear the
Use Compute Engine default service account
checkbox.
This step is important, because the Compute Engine default
service account (and thus the single user you just specified)
could have the Editor role (
roles/editor
) on your project.
In the
Service account email
field, enter
user-managed-notebook-sa@$projectid.iam.gserviceaccount.com
.
(This is the custom service
account email address that you created earlier.) This service
account has limited permissions.
To learn more about granting access, see
Manage access to a user-managed notebooks instance's JupyterLab interface
.

Root access to the instance
Select the following checkbox:
nbconvert
nbconvert
lets users export and download a notebook file as a different file
type, such as HTML, PDF, or LaTeX. This setting is required by some of
the notebooks in the
Google Cloud Generative AI
GitHub repo.
Clear the following checkbox:
File downloading
Select the following checkbox, unless you're in a production environment:
Terminal access
This enables terminal access to your instance from within the
JupyterLab user interface.

Optional: Grant the Service Account User role to the instance user
If you're creating the user-managed notebooks
instance for another user,
you must grant them the
Service Account User role
(
roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
) on the
user-managed-notebook-sa
custom service account as follows:
gcloud
iam
service-accounts
add-iam-policy-binding
\
user-managed-notebook-sa@
PROJECT_ID
.iam.gserviceaccount.com
\
--member
=
"user:
USER_EMAIL
"
\
--role
=
"roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"
Replace the following values:
PROJECT_ID
: the project ID
USER_EMAIL
: the email address for the user
Verify that the user-managed notebooks instance was created
Vertex AI Workbench creates a user-managed notebooks
instance based on your specified properties and automatically starts the
instance.
When the instance is ready to use, Vertex AI Workbench
activates an
Open JupyterLab
link. This link is accessible only to
the single user that you specified at instance creation time.
Open the instance in JupyterLab and verify that the cloned
Google Cloud Generative AI
GitHub repo is present.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
User-managed notebooks
page.
Go to User-managed notebooks
In the list of user-managed notebooks instances,
click the
Open JupyterLab
link for the instance you created.
In the folder list, you'll see a
generative-ai
folder. This
folder contains the cloned GitHub repo.
Monitor health status through Monitoring
You can monitor the system and application metrics for your
user-managed notebooks instances by using the
Google Cloud console. To learn more about instance monitoring and
about creating custom metrics, see
Monitor health status
.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
User-managed notebooks
page.
Go to User-managed notebooks
Click the name of the user-managed notebooks instance
that you want to view the metrics for.
On the
Notebook details
page, click the
Monitoring
tab. Review
the
CPU Utilization
and
Network Bytes
for your notebook instance.
To learn how to interpret these metrics, see
Review resource metrics
.
If you just created the instance, you won't see any data right away. Wait a
few minutes and refresh the console tab.
Create a VM instance schedule for your user-managed notebooks instance
Because a user-managed notebooks instance
is a Compute Engine VM instance, you can use Compute Engine APIs
to create a VM instance schedule for it.
Use a VM instance schedule to start and stop your
user-managed notebooks instance. During the hours when the
instance is stopped, you pay only for Cloud Storage costs.
You can attach an instance schedule to any VM instance that's
in the same region, so you can use the same instance
schedule to control all your user-managed notebooks instances
in the region.
To learn more about VM instance schedules, see
Scheduling a VM instance to start and stop
.
Create a custom IAM role
As a security best practice, we recommend creating a custom IAM
role that has only the following permissions and
assigning it to the Compute Engine default service account:
compute.instances.start
compute.instances.stop
Inside Cloud Shell, create a custom role named
Vm_Scheduler
and include
the necessary permissions:
Go to Cloud Shell
gcloud iam roles create Vm_Scheduler --project=$projectid \
--title=vm-scheduler-notebooks \
--permissions="compute.instances.start,compute.instances.stop" --stage=ga
Describe the custom role:
gcloud iam roles describe Vm_Scheduler --project=$projectid
Assign the role to the Compute Engine default service account
To give the Compute Engine default service
account permission to start and stop your
user-managed notebooks instances, 
you need to assign the
Vm_Scheduler
custom role to it.
The Compute Engine default service account for your project
has the following
email address:
PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
,
where
PROJECT_NUMBER
is your project number.
Identify your project number and store it in the
project_number
shell
variable:
project_number=$(gcloud projects describe $projectid --format 'get(projectNumber)')
echo $project_number
Assign the custom role to the default service account:
gcloud
projects
add
-
iam
-
policy
-
binding
$projectid
--
member
=
"serviceAccount:$project_number-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com"
--
role
=
"projects/$projectid/roles/Vm_Scheduler"
Create and attach the schedule
To create an instance schedule that starts your
user-managed notebooks instance at 7 AM and
stops them at 6 PM:
Create a start and stop schedule named
optimize-notebooks
:
gcloud
compute
resource
-
policies
create
instance
-
schedule
optimize
-
notebooks
\
--
region
=
us
-
central1
\
--
vm
-
start
-
schedule
=
'0
7
*
*
*
'
\
--
vm
-
stop
-
schedule
=
'0
18
*
*
*
'
\
--
timezone
=
TIME_ZONE
Replace
TIME_ZONE
with the location-based
IANA time zone for this instance schedule, for example,
America/Chicago
. If omitted, the default value
UTC
is used. For more information, see
time zone
.
Identify the name of your user-managed notebooks instance
by running the following
command and noting the
NAME
value that it returns:
gcloud compute instances list
Store the name in the
notebook_vm
shell variable:
notebook_vm=
NOTEBOOK_VM_NAME
echo $notebook_vm
Replace
NOTEBOOK_VM_NAME
with your
user-managed notebooks instance name.
Attach the instance schedule to your
user-managed notebooks instance:
gcloud compute instances add-resource-policies $notebook_vm \
  --resource-policies=optimize-notebooks \
  --zone=us-central1-a
Describe the instance schedule:
gcloud
compute
resource
-
policies
describe
optimize
-
notebooks
\
--
region
=
us
-
central1
You can verify if the instance schedule runs successfully by checking the
Compute Engine audit logs
for
the instance schedule resource policy and the attached VM instance.
You might need to wait for up to 15 minutes after the scheduled time
for each operation.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used
in this tutorial, either
delete the project
that contains the resources, or keep the project and delete the individual
resources.
You can delete the individual resources in the project as follows:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
User-managed notebooks
page.
Go to User-managed notebooks
Select your user-managed notebook instance.
Click
Delete
.
In the Cloud Shell, delete the remaining individual resources by
executing the following commands.
