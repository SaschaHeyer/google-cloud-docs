Monitor health status
Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks is
deprecated
. On
    April 14, 2025, support for
    user-managed notebooks ended and the ability to create user-managed notebooks instances
    was removed. Existing instances will continue to function until
    March 30, 2026, but patches, updates, and upgrades
    won't be available. To continue using Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you
migrate
    your user-managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances
.
User-managed notebooks instances provide several methods
for monitoring the health
of your notebooks. This page describes how
to use each method.
Methods for monitoring health status
You can monitor the health of your user-managed notebooks
instances in a few different ways. This page describes how to
use the following methods:
Use guest attributes to report
system health
Report custom metrics to Cloud Monitoring
Report system and application metrics
to Monitoring by installing Monitoring
on a user-managed notebooks instance
Use the diagnostic tool
Set up the gcloud CLI
To complete some of the steps on this page, you need to use the
Google Cloud CLI.
Install
the Google Cloud CLI.
        
          After installation,
initialize
the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud
init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity
.
Note:
You can run the gcloud CLI in
      the Google Cloud console without installing the Google Cloud CLI. To run the
      gcloud CLI in the Google Cloud console,
use
        Cloud Shell
.
Use guest attributes to report system health
You can use guest attributes to report the system health of the following
core services:
Docker service
Docker reverse proxy agent
Jupyter service
Jupyter API
Guest attributes
are a specific type of custom metadata that
applications can write to while running on
your user-managed notebooks
instance. To learn more about guest attributes,
see
About VM metadata
.
How instances use guest attributes to report system health
The
notebooks-collection-agent
service runs a Python process
in the background that verifies the status of
the user-managed notebooks
instance's core services and updates the guest attributes as either
1
if no problems are detected or
-1
if a failure is detected.
To use the
notebooks-collection-agent
service to
report on your user-managed notebooks instance's health,
you must enable the following guest attributes
while
creating
a user-managed notebooks instance:
enable-guest-attributes=TRUE
: This enables guest
attributes on your user-managed notebooks instance. All new
instances enable this attribute by default.
report-system-health=TRUE
: This records system
health check results to your guest attributes.
The
notebooks-collection-agent
service doesn't need
any special permissions to write to the instance's guest attributes.
Note:
The
notebooks-collection-agent
service uses
approximately 50 MB of memory to run in the background.
Create a user-managed notebooks instance with system health guest attributes enabled
To use system health guest attributes to report
on your user-managed notebooks instance's health,
you must select the
Enable system health report
checkbox when you create
a user-managed notebooks instance.
You can enable the system health report by using either the Google Cloud console
or the Google Cloud CLI.
Before you begin
Before you can create a user-managed notebooks instance,
you must have a
Google Cloud project and enable the Notebooks API
for that project.
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
        Google Cloud,
create an account
to evaluate how our products perform in
        real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
        run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
        select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project
: Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
      IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
      granted a role on.
Create a project
: To create a project, you need the Project Creator
      (
roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create
permission.
Learn how to grant
      roles
.
Note
: If you don't plan to keep the
    resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
    selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
    delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project
.
Enable the Notebooks API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
          role (
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin
), which
          contains the
serviceusage.services.enable
permission.
Learn how to grant
          roles
.
Enable the API
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
        select or create a Google Cloud project.

          role (
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin
), which
          contains the
serviceusage.services.enable
permission.
Learn how to grant
          roles
.
Enable the API
If you plan to use GPUs with your
  user-managed notebooks instance,
check the quotas page in the
  Google Cloud console
to ensure that you have enough GPUs available in your project. If GPUs
  are not listed on the quotas page, or you require additional GPU quota,
  you can request a quota increase. See
Requesting an increase in
  quota
on the
  Compute Engine
Resource quotas
page.
Required roles
If you created the project, you have the
  Owner (
roles/owner
) IAM role on the project,
  which includes all required permissions. Skip this section and
  start creating your user-managed notebooks instance. If you didn't
  create the project yourself, continue in this section.
To get the permissions that
      you need to create a Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks instance,
    
      ask your administrator to grant you the
    following IAM roles on the project:
Notebooks Admin (
roles/notebooks.admin
)
Service Account User (
roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
)
For more information about granting roles, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations
.
You might also be able to get
        the required permissions through
custom
        roles
or other
predefined
        roles
.

INSTANCE_NAME
\
    --zone
ZONE
Replace the following:
INSTANCE_NAME
: the name of your instance
ZONE
: the zone where your instance is located
If your core services are healthy, the results look like the following.
A value of
1
means no failure was detected.
NAMESPACE   KEY                         VALUE
 notebooks   docker_proxy_agent_status   1
 notebooks   docker_status               1
 notebooks   jupyterlab_api_status       1
 notebooks   jupyterlab_status           1
 notebooks   system-health               1
 notebooks   updated                     2020-10-01 17:00:00.12345
If any of the four core services fail, system-health reports a
-1
value to indicate system failure. In most cases,
a system failure means that JupyterLab is not accessible.
An example of a failure result might look like the following.
NAMESPACE   KEY                         VALUE

gcloud with Vertex AI Workbench
To monitor your system health, you can use the
getInstanceHealth
method to retrieve
the values of your guest attributes.
The following example shows how to do this using
the gcloud CLI.
gcloud notebooks instances is-healthy example-instance \
    --location=
ZONE
Replace
ZONE
with the zone where your instance
is located, for example,
us-west1-a
.
If your core services are healthy, the results look like the following.
A value of
1
means no failure was detected.
{
          "health_state": HEALTHY,
          "docker-proxy-agent": 1,
          "docker-service": 1,
          "jupyter-service": 1,
          "jupyter-api": 1,
          "last-updated": "2020-10-01 17:00:30.12345"
  }
An example of a failure result might look like the following.
{
          "healthy": UNHEALTHY,
          "docker-proxy-agent": 1,
          "docker-service": 1,
          "jupyter-service": -1,
          "jupyter-api": -1,
          "last-updated": "2020-10-01 17:00:30.12345"
  }
Report custom metrics to Monitoring
User-managed notebooks instances let you
collect system status and JupyterLab metrics
and report them to Cloud Monitoring. These custom metrics
are different from the standard metrics that are reported when
you
install Monitoring on
your user-managed notebooks instance
.
The custom metrics reported to Monitoring include the following:
The system health of these user-managed notebooks core services:
Docker service
Docker reverse proxy agent
Jupyter service
Jupyter API
The following JupyterLab metrics:
Number of kernels
Number of terminals
Number of connections
Number of sessions
Maximum memory
High memory
Current memory
How instances report custom metrics to Monitoring
To report custom metrics to Monitoring, you must enable
the
report-notebook-metrics
metadata setting
while
creating
a user-managed notebooks instance.
You must also make sure that the user-managed notebooks
instance's service account
has Monitoring Metric Writer (
roles/monitoring.metricWriter
)
permissions. For more information, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations
.
Create a user-managed notebooks instance that reports custom metrics to Monitoring
To report custom metrics to Monitoring, you must select
the
Report custom metrics to Cloud Monitoring
checkbox
when you create a user-managed notebooks instance.
You can enable reporting custom metrics to Cloud Monitoring by using either
the Google Cloud console or the Google Cloud CLI.
