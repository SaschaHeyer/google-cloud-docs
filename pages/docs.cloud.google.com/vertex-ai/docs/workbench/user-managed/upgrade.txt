Upgrade the environment of a user-managed notebooks instance
Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks is
deprecated
. On
    April 14, 2025, support for
    user-managed notebooks ended and the ability to create user-managed notebooks instances
    was removed. Existing instances will continue to function until
    March 30, 2026, but patches, updates, and upgrades
    won't be available. To continue using Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you
migrate
    your user-managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances
.
Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks instances are
Deep Learning VM Images
instances
with JupyterLab notebook environments enabled and ready for use.
This page describes how to upgrade the environment of
a user-managed notebooks instance.
Reasons to upgrade
You might want to upgrade the environment of
your user-managed notebooks instance
for any of the following reasons:
To use new capabilities that are only available in a newer version
of your environment.
To benefit from framework updates, package updates, and bug fixes
that have been implemented in a newer version of your environment.
Upgrade methods
There are two ways to upgrade a user-managed notebooks instance:
Automatic upgrade
: Enable auto upgrade when you create
a user-managed notebooks instance. During a recurring
time period that you specify, Vertex AI Workbench checks whether
your instance can be upgraded, and if so,
Vertex AI Workbench upgrades your instance.
Manual upgrade
: If
an existing user-managed notebooks instance
meets the
requirements
for upgrading, you can upgrade the instance manually.
Requirements and limitations
Backward compatibility with your user-managed notebooks isn't
guaranteed.
Make a copy of
your data
before upgrading a user-managed notebooks instance.
To determine whether you can upgrade
a specific user-managed notebooks instance,
see the following requirements and limitations:
The Notebooks API must be
enabled in the instance's
Google Cloud project
.
For more information, see
List enabled services
and
Enable an API
.
The user-managed notebooks instance's
environment version
must be M54 or higher.
The user-managed notebooks instance must have been created using
the Notebooks API or must have been
registered with the
Notebooks API
.
If your user-managed notebooks instance is container-based,
Vertex AI Workbench upgrades the OS. The image version depends on
the specific image pulled by your Dockerfile.
To help make sure the upgrade uses the most recent version
of the image, consider using the
latest
tag in
your Dockerfile.
If upgrading your instance is not an option for you,
consider
migrating your data to
a new user-managed notebooks instance
.
How the upgrade works
User-managed notebooks instances that can be upgraded
are dual-disk, with one boot disk and one data disk.
The upgrade process upgrades the boot disk
to a new image while preserving your data on the data disk.
Which components are upgraded or preserved?
The following table shows which components of
your user-managed notebooks
instance are upgraded and which are preserved.

User-installed libraries
By default, user-managed notebooks instances store
pip and Conda libraries in the boot disk, which is replaced during an upgrade.
When you install pip libraries, you can include the
--user
flag to
install them in the
/home/jupyter/
directory,
where they are preserved during an upgrade.
By default, if you install pip or Conda libraries in a kernel created from a
custom container, the libraries only persist while the kernel is running.
Each time the kernel is restarted, those libraries will need to be
reinstalled. To install persistent libraries in a custom container,
include the library installations in your Dockerfile. When installing
pip libraries in a kernel created from a custom container, you can include
the
--user
flag so that the libraries will persist until instance restart.
Environment versions
Vertex AI Workbench updates environments regularly (
see the
Deep Learning VM release
notes
), but with each
released version, not all of
the
environments
are updated.
Vertex AI Workbench only upgrades an instance if there is a newer
environment version for the VM image that your instance is based on.
For information about how to use a specific version to create
a user-managed notebooks instance, see
Create a specific version of a user-managed notebooks
instance
.
Before you upgrade
Before you upgrade, complete the following steps.
Check the
release notes
to learn about
updates to newer versions.
Make a copy of
your data
as a backup.
Automatic upgrade
Vertex AI Workbench can automatically upgrade instances that are
running. If your instance is stopped, it doesn't automatically upgrade your
instance, even if you enabled auto upgrade when you created it.
When you enable automatic environment upgrades, you specify
a recurring time period in which Vertex AI Workbench checks
whether the instance can be upgraded, and if it can be, upgrades the instance.
The time period you specify is stored as a
notebook-upgrade-schedule
metadata entry, in
unix-cron
format
, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
To check whether an instance can be upgraded,
Vertex AI Workbench uses the API method
isUpgradeable
.
This method checks for a newer version of the image on the instance's
boot disk.
If the instance can be upgraded, Vertex AI Workbench uses an
internal upgrade method to upgrade the instance.
Create a user-managed notebooks instance with auto upgrade enabled
To create a user-managed notebooks instance with auto upgrade
enabled, select the
Enable environment auto-upgrade
checkbox and set a
schedule when you create the instance.
You can specify auto-upgrade by using either the Google Cloud console or the
Google Cloud CLI.
Before you begin
Before you can create a user-managed notebooks instance,
you must have a
Google Cloud project and enable the Notebooks API
for that project.
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
        Google Cloud,
create an account
to evaluate how our products perform in
        real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
        run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
        select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project
: Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
      IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
      granted a role on.
Create a project
: To create a project, you need the Project Creator
      (
roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create
permission.
Learn how to grant
      roles
.
Note
: If you don't plan to keep the
    resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
    selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
    delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project
.
Enable the Notebooks API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
          role (
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin
), which
          contains the
serviceusage.services.enable
permission.
Learn how to grant
          roles
.
Enable the API
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
        select or create a Google Cloud project.

permission.
Learn how to grant
          roles
.
Enable the API
If you plan to use GPUs with your
  user-managed notebooks instance,
check the quotas page in the
  Google Cloud console
to ensure that you have enough GPUs available in your project. If GPUs
  are not listed on the quotas page, or you require additional GPU quota,
  you can request a quota increase. See
Requesting an increase in
  quota
on the
  Compute Engine
Resource quotas
page.
Required roles
If you created the project, you have the
  Owner (
roles/owner
) IAM role on the project,
  which includes all required permissions. Skip this section and
  start creating your user-managed notebooks instance. If you didn't
  create the project yourself, continue in this section.
To get the permissions that
      you need to create a Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks instance,
    
      ask your administrator to grant you the
    following IAM roles on the project:
Notebooks Admin (
roles/notebooks.admin
)
Service Account User (
roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
)
For more information about granting roles, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations
.
You might also be able to get
        the required permissions through
custom
        roles
or other
predefined
        roles
.
Create the instance
