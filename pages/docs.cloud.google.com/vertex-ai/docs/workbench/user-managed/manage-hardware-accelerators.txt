Change machine type and configure GPUs of a user-managed notebooks instance
Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks is
deprecated
. On
    April 14, 2025, support for
    user-managed notebooks ended and the ability to create user-managed notebooks instances
    was removed. Existing instances will continue to function until
    March 30, 2026, but patches, updates, and upgrades
    won't be available. To continue using Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you
migrate
    your user-managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances
.
This page shows you how to change the machine type and
GPU configuration of a user-managed notebooks instance.
Overview
The machine type determines some specifications of
your user-managed notebooks instance,
such as the amount of memory, virtual cores, and persistent disk limits.
Changing the machine type can improve performance or help avoid errors
caused by high memory utilization.
GPUs provide hardware acceleration that can improve the performance
of your notebook code. You may want to add or increase the number of GPUs
for greater performance, or, to reduce the cost of running
your user-managed notebooks instance,
you may want to remove GPUs.
Before you change a machine type or GPU configuration
Consider the following before you make any changes to
your user-managed notebooks instance's machine type
or GPU configuration.
Billing implications
Each machine type and GPU configuration is billed at a different rate.
Make sure you understand
the
pricing
implications of making a change.
For example, an
e2-highmem-2
machine type costs more than an
e2-standard-2
machine type.
Changing a machine type might also affect sustained use discounts.
Sustained use discounts are calculated
separately for different
categories
in
the same region. If you change machine types so that the new machine type is
in a different category, the subsequent running time of
your instance's VM counts toward the
sustained use discount of the new category.
Moving to a smaller machine type
If you move from a machine type with more resources to a machine type with fewer
resources, such as moving from an
e2-standard-8
machine type to an
e2-standard-2
, you might run into hardware resource issues or performance
limitations because smaller machine types are less powerful than larger machine
types.
Make a backup
It's good practice to make regular backups of
your instance's persistent disk data using snapshots. Consider
taking a
snapshot
of your
persistent disk data before you change the machine type. If you want to make
sure the new machine type is able to support the data on the existing instance,
you can take a persistent disk snapshot and use it to start a second instance
with the new machine type to confirm that the instance starts up successfully.
Change the machine type and configure GPUs
Note:
To change the machine type or GPUs for
    a user-managed notebooks instance,
    you must
shut down the user-managed notebooks
    instance
.
To change the machine type or configure the GPUs on
a user-managed notebooks instance, complete the following steps.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
User-managed notebooks
page.
Go to User-managed notebooks
In the
Notebook name
column, click the name of the
instance that you want to modify.
The
Notebook details
page opens.
Click the
Hardware
tab.
In the
Modify hardware configuration
section,
select the
Machine type
that you want to use.
If there are GPUs available for your instance's combination of
zone, environment, and machine type, you can configure the GPUs.
In the
GPUs
section, select the
GPU type
and
Number of GPUs
that you want to use.
Learn more about GPU regions and zone
availability
.
If you haven't already installed the required GPU drivers on your instance,
select
Install NVIDIA GPU driver automatically for me
to install the drivers automatically on next startup.
After Vertex AI Workbench has finished updating the machine type
and GPU configuration, you can start
your user-managed notebooks instance.

GPU platforms
