Create a user-managed notebooks instance with a custom container
Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks is
deprecated
. On
    April 14, 2025, support for
    user-managed notebooks ended and the ability to create user-managed notebooks instances
    was removed. Existing instances will continue to function until
    March 30, 2026, but patches, updates, and upgrades
    won't be available. To continue using Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you
migrate
    your user-managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances
.
You can create a user-managed notebooks instance based on a custom
container. Using a custom container lets you customize a
user-managed notebooks environment for your specific needs.
The container must be accessible to your
Google Cloud service account and expose a service on port 8080.
We recommend creating a container derived from a
Deep Learning Containers
image
,
because those images are already configured to be compatible
with user-managed notebooks.
How custom container kernels are updated
Vertex AI Workbench pulls the latest container image for your kernel:
When you create your instance.
When you upgrade your instance.
When you start your instance.
The custom container kernel doesn't persist when your instance is stopped,
so each time your instance is started, Vertex AI Workbench pulls
the latest version of the container image.
If your instance is running when a new version of a container is released,
your instance's kernel isn't updated until you stop and start your instance.
Before you begin
Before you can create a user-managed notebooks instance,
you must have a
Google Cloud project and enable the Notebooks API
for that project.
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
        Google Cloud,
create an account
to evaluate how our products perform in
        real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
        run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
        select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project
: Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
      IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
      granted a role on.
Create a project
: To create a project, you need the Project Creator
      (
roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create
permission.
Learn how to grant
      roles
.
Note
: If you don't plan to keep the
    resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
    selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
    delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project
.
Enable the Notebooks API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
          role (
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin
), which
          contains the
serviceusage.services.enable
permission.
Learn how to grant
          roles
.
Enable the API
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
        select or create a Google Cloud project.

To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
          role (
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin
), which
          contains the
serviceusage.services.enable
permission.
Learn how to grant
          roles
.
Enable the API
If you plan to use GPUs with your
  user-managed notebooks instance,
check the quotas page in the
  Google Cloud console
to ensure that you have enough GPUs available in your project. If GPUs
  are not listed on the quotas page, or you require additional GPU quota,
  you can request a quota increase. See
Requesting an increase in
  quota
on the
  Compute Engine
Resource quotas
page.
Required roles
If you created the project, you have the
  Owner (
roles/owner
) IAM role on the project,
  which includes all required permissions. Skip this section and
  start creating your user-managed notebooks instance. If you didn't
  create the project yourself, continue in this section.
To get the permissions that
      you need to create a Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks instance,
    
      ask your administrator to grant you the
    following IAM roles on the project:
Notebooks Admin (
roles/notebooks.admin
)
Service Account User (
roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
)
For more information about granting roles, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations
.
You might also be able to get
        the required permissions through
custom
        roles
or other
predefined
        roles
.
Make sure your custom container is ready
Make sure you have a custom container that is accessible to your
Google Cloud service account. For information about how to create a
custom container from a
Deep Learning Containers image
, see
Creating a derivative container
.
Create an instance with a custom container
To create a user-managed notebooks instance
with a custom container, complete the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
User-managed notebooks
page.
Or go to
notebook.new
(https://notebook.new) and skip the next step.
Go to User-managed notebooks
Click
add_box
Create new
.
Click
Advanced options
.
On the
Create instance
page,
in the
Details
section,
provide the following information for your new instance:
Name
: a name for your new instance
Region
and
Zone
: Select a region and zone for
the new instance. For best network performance,
select the region that is geographically closest to you.
See the available
user-managed notebooks
locations
.
In the
Environment
section, in the
Environment
field,
select
Custom container
.
In the
Docker container image
field, add a Docker container image
in one of the following ways:
Enter a Docker container image path. For example,
to use a TensorFlow 2.12 container image with accelerators from
Deep Learning Containers
,
enter
us-docker.pkg.dev/deeplearning-platform-release/gcr.io/tf-cpu.2-12.py310
.
Click
Select
to add a Docker container image from
Artifact Registry. Then on the
Artifact Registry
tab
where your container image is stored, change the project
to the project that includes your container image, and select
your container image.
Make the rest of your selections, or leave them on their default
setting.
Click
Create
. Vertex AI Workbench creates
a user-managed notebooks instance for you, based
on your custom container.
What's next
Read about how to
push container images to
Artifact Registry
.
If the container images you push to Artifact Registry are derived from
a
Deep Learning Containers
image
,
you can use these container images when creating
user-managed notebooks instances.
Learn more about modifying your custom containers by reading
Best practices for writing
Dockerfiles
