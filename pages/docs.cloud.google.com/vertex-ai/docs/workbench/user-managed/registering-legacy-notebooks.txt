Register a legacy instance with Notebooks API
Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks is
deprecated
. On
    April 14, 2025, support for
    user-managed notebooks ended and the ability to create user-managed notebooks instances
    was removed. Existing instances will continue to function until
    March 30, 2026, but patches, updates, and upgrades
    won't be available. To continue using Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you
migrate
    your user-managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances
.
This page shows how to migrate and register a legacy
user-managed notebooks instance with the Notebooks API. Instances
created by using the Compute Engine API are called legacy instances. Legacy
instances don't have the latest updates to functionality and features.
To use the new functionality and features that are available with the
Notebooks API, you must
register
your legacy instances with
the Notebooks API. Before registering your legacy instances, check whether
they meet the
requirements
. You can
migrate
instances that don't meet the requirements.
If you enable the Notebooks API before registering your legacy instances, the
Notebooks API activation process attempts to register your existing legacy
instances automatically.
Requirements and limitations
Before registering your legacy instances with the Notebooks API, consider
the following requirements and limitations.
Source and destination zones must match and be a valid zone
for the Notebooks API.
For example, a legacy user-managed notebooks instance
in
us-west1-a
remains in
us-west1-a
when it is registered with
the Notebooks API. However, a legacy user-managed notebooks
instance in
us-central1-f
won't register with the Notebooks API because
us-central1-f
isn't a valid zone for the Notebooks API.
To get a list of the valid zones for the Notebooks API notebooks instances,
run the following command by using the
Google Cloud CLI
in
your preferred terminal or in
Cloud Shell
:
gcloud
notebooks
locations
list
If your legacy instance's zone is not a valid zone for the Notebooks API,
you can contact
support
or your account manager, or you can
migrate the legacy instance to a
new user-managed notebooks
instance
.
Only dual-disk instances can use all user-managed notebooks
features.
Single-disk legacy instances cannot use some
user-managed notebooks features, such as auto upgrade, even
after they are registered with the Notebooks API. To enable your
single-disk legacy instance to use all available features, you must
migrate your single-disk instance to a dual-disk
instance
.
You can migrate your single-disk instance to a dual-disk instance as part
of your migration from a legacy instance to an instance registered with the
Notebooks API. If you've already registered the legacy instance with the
Notebooks API, you can still migrate the instance to a
new
dual-disk
instance to resolve the issue.
To verify the number of disks, complete the following steps.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
VM instances
page.
Go to VM instances
Find your current legacy user-managed notebooks
instance.
Click the instance name to open the
VM instance details
page.
In the
boot disk
and
additional disks
sections, verify
how many disks are attached to the VM.
gcloud
In
Cloud Shell
or any environment where the
Google Cloud CLI
is installed, enter the following
Google Cloud CLI
command:
gcloud
compute
instances
describe
MY_INSTANCE_NAME
\
--zone
=
MY_ZONE
Replace the following:
MY_INSTANCE_NAME
: the name of your instance
MY_ZONE
: the zone of your instance
Review the information that follows
disks:
, and verify
how many disks are attached to the VM.
Migrate a legacy instance to a new user-managed notebooks instance
If your legacy user-managed notebooks instance is in a zone that
isn't a valid zone for the Notebooks API, or if you want to migrate from a
single-disk instance to a dual-disk instance, you must create a user-managed notebooks instance and copy your user data from your
legacy instance to the new instance.
To create a user-managed notebooks instance and copy your user
data from your legacy instance to the new instance, complete the following
steps:
To use
ssh
to connect to your legacy instance, in
Cloud Shell
or any environment where the
Google Cloud CLI
is installed, enter the following
Google Cloud CLI
command:
export
PROJECT_ID
=
"
MY_PROJECT_ID
"
export
ZONE
=
"
MY_ZONE
"
export
INSTANCE_NAME
=
"
MY_INSTANCE
"
gcloud
compute
ssh
\
--
project
$
PROJECT_ID
\
--
zone
$
ZONE
$
INSTANCE_NAME
\
--
-
L
8080
:
localhost
:
8080
Replace the following:
MY_PROJECT_ID
: the ID of your Google Cloud project
MY_ZONE
: the zone of your instance
MY_INSTANCE
: the name of your instance
with the relevant information.
To copy the contents of the legacy instance to a
Cloud Storage
bucket, use
gcloud storage
. The following example command copies all of
the notebook (
.ipynb
) files from the default directory
/home/jupyter/
to a Cloud Storage directory named
my-bucket/legacy-notebooks
.
gcloud
storage
cp
/home/jupyter/*.ipynb
gs://my-bucket/legacy-notebooks/
--recursive
Create a user-managed notebooks instance
with the same hardware
specifications as the legacy instance.
In this example, Vertex AI Workbench creates
a user-managed notebooks instance named
new-notebook
in the
example
project
using the latest TensorFlow 2 image, with an
n1-standard-1
machine type, in the
us-west1-a
zone.
In either
Cloud Shell
or any environment where the
Google Cloud CLI
is installed, enter the following
Google Cloud CLI
command:
gcloud
notebooks
instances
create
new-notebook
\
--vm-image-project
=
example
\
--vm-image-family
=
tf-latest-cpu
\
--machine-type
=
n1-standard-1
\
--location
=
us-west1-a
The new user-managed notebooks instance is dual-disk.
It has a boot disk and a data disk.
Use
ssh
to connect to the user-managed notebooks instance
that you just created.
To copy the contents of the legacy instance from the
Cloud Storage bucket to the new instance, use
gcloud storage
.
The following example command copies all of
the notebook (
.ipynb
) files from the Cloud Storage directory
to the new instance's
/home/jupyter/
directory.
gcloud
storage
cp
gs://my-bucket/legacy-notebooks/*.ipynb
/home/jupyter/
--recursive
In the new user-managed notebooks instance,
open JupyterLab and confirm
that the user data and assets have been successfully copied.
Optional: delete the legacy instance.
Register a legacy instance with the Notebooks API
To use the Notebooks API to manage your legacy instances, you must register
your legacy instances with the Notebooks API.
If you enable the Notebooks API before registering your legacy instances,
the Notebooks API activation process attempts to register your existing legacy
instances automatically. If you create legacy instances after the Notebooks API
is enabled, you must register them manually by using one of the following
methods.
To register your legacy instance with the Notebooks API, you can
use the Google Cloud console or the Notebooks API.
Console
To use the
Register all
option in the Google Cloud console,
complete the following steps:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
User-managed notebooks
page.
Go to User-managed notebooks
If you have one or more legacy
user-managed notebooks instances,
a message appears indicating that you need to register them
with the Notebooks API. Next to this message, click
Register all
.
If you do not have any legacy user-managed notebooks
instances, but have not yet enabled the Notebooks API, click
Enable
Notebooks API
to ensure that new user-managed notebooks
instances are created by using the Notebooks API.
Notebooks API
To use the
register
method provided by the Notebooks API, in
Cloud Shell
or any environment where the
Google Cloud CLI
is installed, enter the following
Google Cloud CLI
command:
gcloud
notebooks
instances
register
MY_INSTANCE_NAME
\
--location
=
MY_ZONE
Replace the following:
MY_INSTANCE_NAME
: the name of your instance
MY_ZONE
: the zone of your instance
