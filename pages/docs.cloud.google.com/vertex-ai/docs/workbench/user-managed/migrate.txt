Migrate data to a new user-managed notebooks instance
Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks is
deprecated
. On
    April 14, 2025, support for
    user-managed notebooks ended and the ability to create user-managed notebooks instances
    was removed. Existing instances will continue to function until
    March 30, 2026, but patches, updates, and upgrades
    won't be available. To continue using Vertex AI Workbench, we recommend that you
migrate
    your user-managed notebooks instances to Vertex AI Workbench instances
.
This page describes how to migrate data and files from
an existing user-managed notebooks instance to a new one.
When to migrate
You might need to migrate your data to
a new user-managed notebooks instance if
you can't upgrade the environment of your existing instance.
See the
requirements for upgrading the environment of
a user-managed notebooks instance
.
Migration options
To migrate data and files from one user-managed notebooks instance to another,
consider using the following methods:
Use GitHub
: Copy your data and files to a GitHub repository
by using the Git extension for JupyterLab.
To use this method,
see
Save a notebook to
GitHub
.
Use Cloud Storage and the terminal
: Copy your data and files
to Cloud Storage and then to another instance by using the terminal.
Use Cloud Storage within JupyterLab notebooks
:
Copy your data and files to Cloud Storage and then to another instance
by running commands within your respective instances' notebook cells.
This guide describes how to migrate data and files by using
Cloud Storage and the terminal.
Requirements
You must have terminal access to your user-managed notebooks instance.
Terminal access is manually set when you create an instance. The
terminal access setting cannot be changed after the instance is created.
Before you begin
Create a Cloud Storage bucket
in the same project where your user-managed notebooks instance
is located.
Migrate your data to a new user-managed notebooks instance
To migrate data and files to a new user-managed notebooks instance
by using Cloud Storage and the terminal, complete the following steps.
In your user-managed notebooks instance's
JupyterLab interface, select
File
>
New
>
Terminal
to open a terminal window.

Or connect to your instance's terminal
by
using SSH
.
Use the
gcloud CLI
to copy your user data
to a Cloud Storage bucket. The following example command
copies all of the files from your instance's
/home/jupyter/
directory
to a directory in a Cloud Storage bucket.
gcloud
storage
cp
/home/jupyter/*
gs://
BUCKET_NAME
PATH
--recursive
Replace the following:
BUCKET_NAME
: the name of your
Cloud Storage bucket
PATH
: the path to the directory
where you want to copy your files, for example:
/copy/jupyter/
Open your user-managed notebooks instance's JupyterLab interface.
In your user-managed notebooks instance's
JupyterLab interface, select
File
>
New
>
Terminal
to open a terminal window.
Use the gcloud CLI to restore your data on the new instance.
The following example command copies all of
the files from a Cloud Storage directory to the
your new instance's
/home/jupyter/
directory.
gcloud
storage
cp
gs://
BUCKET_NAME
PATH
*
/home/jupyter/
What's next
Learn how to
automatically and manually upgrade the environment of
user-managed notebooks instances
.
Learn more about
using
SSH access
to connect
to your user-managed notebooks instance.
