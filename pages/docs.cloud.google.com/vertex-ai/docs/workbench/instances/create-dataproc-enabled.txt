Create a Dataproc Spark-enabled instance
Dataproc Serverless
is now
Google Cloud Serverless for Apache Spark
.
Until updated, the Google Cloud console and JupyterLab pages
will refer to the previous name.
This page describes how to create a Dataproc Spark-enabled
Vertex AI Workbench instance. This page also describes the benefits
of the Dataproc JupyterLab extension and provides an overview
on how to use the extension with Serverless for Apache Spark and
Dataproc on Compute Engine.
Overview of the Dataproc JupyterLab extension
Vertex AI Workbench instances have the Dataproc
JupyterLab extension preinstalled, as of version
M113
and later.
Note:
You can also
install and use the
      Dataproc JupyterLab extension on your local machine or
      a Compute Engine VM
      instance
.
The Dataproc JupyterLab extension provides two ways to run
Apache Spark notebook jobs: Dataproc clusters and
Google Cloud Serverless for Apache Spark.
Dataproc clusters
include a rich set
    of features with control over the infrastructure that Spark runs on.
    You choose the size and configuration of your Spark cluster, allowing
    for customization and control over your environment. This approach is
    ideal for complex workloads, long-running jobs, and
    fine-grained resource management.
Serverless for Apache Spark
eliminates infrastructure concerns. You submit your Spark jobs, and
    Google handles the provisioning, scaling, and optimization of resources
    behind the scenes. This serverless approach offers a
    cost-efficient option for data science and ML workloads.
With both options, you can use Spark for data processing
  and analysis. The choice between Dataproc clusters and
  Serverless for Apache Spark depends on your specific
  workload requirements, required level of control, and resource usage patterns.
Benefits of using Serverless for Apache Spark for data science and
  ML workloads include:
No cluster management
: You don't need to worry
    about provisioning, configuring, or managing Spark clusters. This saves
    you time and resources.
Autoscaling
: Serverless for Apache Spark
    automatically scales up and down based on the workload, so you only pay
    for the resources you use.
High performance
: Serverless for Apache Spark
    is optimized for performance and takes advantage of Google Cloud's
    infrastructure.
Integration with other Google Cloud technologies
:
    Serverless for Apache Spark integrates with other
    Google Cloud products, such as BigQuery and
    Dataplex Universal Catalog.
For more information, see the
Google Cloud Serverless for Apache Spark documentation
.

Required roles
To ensure that the service account has the necessary
      permissions to run a notebook file on a Serverless for Apache Spark cluster or a Dataproc cluster,
    
      ask your administrator to grant the service account the
    following IAM roles:
Important:
You must grant these roles
      to the service account,
not
to your user account. Failure to grant the roles to the correct principal might result in permission errors.
Dataproc Worker
(
roles/dataproc.worker
)
    
              on your project
Dataproc Editor
(
roles/dataproc.editor
)
    
              on the cluster for the
dataproc.clusters.use
permission
For more information about granting roles, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations
.
These predefined roles contain
        
        the permissions required to run a notebook file on a Serverless for Apache Spark cluster or a Dataproc cluster. To see the exact permissions that are
        required, expand the
Required permissions

.
Vertex AI Workbench creates an instance and automatically starts it.
When the instance is ready to use, Vertex AI Workbench
activates an
Open JupyterLab
link.
Note:
Specific network configurations could affect your ability to use
      the Dataproc extension. For more information on how to
      ensure that your network configuration is compatible, see
Network configuration options
.
Open JupyterLab
Next to your instance's name, click
Open JupyterLab
.
The JupyterLab
Launcher
tab opens in your browser. By default it contains
sections for
Serverless for Apache Spark Notebooks
and
Dataproc Jobs and Sessions
. If there are
Jupyter-ready clusters in the selected project and region, there will be
a section called
Dataproc Cluster Notebooks
.
Use the extension with Serverless for Apache Spark
Serverless for Apache Spark runtime templates that are in the same region and project
as your Vertex AI Workbench instance appear in the
Serverless for Apache Spark Notebooks
section of the JupyterLab
Launcher
tab.
To create a runtime template, see
Create a Serverless for Apache Spark
runtime template
.
To open a new serverless Spark notebook, click a runtime template. It
takes about a minute for the remote Spark kernel to start. After the kernel
starts, you can start coding.
Use the extension with Dataproc on Compute Engine
If you created a
Dataproc on Compute Engine
Jupyter cluster
,
the
Launcher
tab has
a
Dataproc Cluster Notebooks
section.
Four cards appear for each Jupyter-ready Dataproc cluster
that you have access to in that region and project.
To change the region and project, do the following:
Select
Settings
>
Cloud Dataproc Settings
.
On the
Setup Config
tab, under
Project Info
, change the
Project ID
and
Region
, and then click
Save
.
These changes don't take effect until you restart JupyterLab.
To restart JupyterLab, select
File
>
Shut Down
, and
then click
Open JupyterLab
on the
Vertex AI Workbench instances
page.
To create a new notebook, click a card. After the remote kernel on the
Dataproc cluster starts, you can start writing your code
and then run it on your cluster.
Manage Dataproc on an instance using the gcloud CLI and the API
This section describes ways to manage Dataproc on a
Vertex AI Workbench instance.
Change the region of your Dataproc cluster
Your Vertex AI Workbench instance's default kernels, such as
Python and TensorFlow, are local kernels that run in the instance's VM.
On a Dataproc Spark-enabled Vertex AI Workbench instance,
your notebook runs on a Dataproc cluster through a remote kernel.
The remote kernel runs on a service outside of your instance's VM,
which lets you access any Dataproc cluster within the same
project.
By default Vertex AI Workbench uses Dataproc clusters
within the same region as your instance, but you can
change the Dataproc
region
as long as the
Component Gateway
and
the
optional Jupyter component
are enabled on the Dataproc cluster.
Test Access
The Dataproc JupyterLab extension is enabled by default for
Vertex AI Workbench instances. To test access to Dataproc,
you can check access to your instance's remote kernels by sending the following
curl request to the
kernels.googleusercontent.com
domain:
curl --verbose -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" https://
PROJECT_ID
-dot-
REGION
.kernels.googleusercontent.com/api/kernelspecs | jq .
If the curl command fails, check to make sure that:
Your DNS entries are configured correctly.
There is a cluster available in the same project (or you will need to create one if it doesn't exist).
Your cluster has both the
Component Gateway
and
the
optional Jupyter component
enabled.
Turn off Dataproc
Vertex AI Workbench instances are created with Dataproc
enabled by default. You can create a Vertex AI Workbench instance with
Dataproc turned off by setting the
disable-mixer
metadata
key to
true
.
gcloud
workbench
instances
create
INSTANCE_NAME
--metadata
=
disable-mixer
=
