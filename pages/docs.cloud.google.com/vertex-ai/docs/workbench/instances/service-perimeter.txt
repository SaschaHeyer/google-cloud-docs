Use an instance within a service perimeter
This page describes how to use VPC Service Controls to set up
a Vertex AI Workbench instance within a service perimeter.
Before you begin
Read the
Overview of
VPC Service Controls
.
Create a Vertex AI Workbench
instance
.
This instance is not within a service
perimeter yet.
Create a service perimeter using
VPC Service Controls
.
This service perimeter protects the Google-managed resources of services
that you specify. While creating your service perimeter, do the following:
When it's time to add projects to your service perimeter, add the
project that contains your Vertex AI Workbench instance.
When it's time to add services to your service perimeter, add the
Notebooks API
.
If you have created your service perimeter without adding the
projects and services you need, see
Managing service
perimeters
to learn how to update your service perimeter.
Configure your DNS entries using Cloud DNS
Vertex AI Workbench  instances use several domains that a
  Virtual Private Cloud network doesn't handle by default.
  To ensure that your VPC network correctly handles requests sent
  to those domains, use Cloud DNS to add DNS records. For more
  information about VPC routes, see
Routes
.
To create a
managed zone
for
  a domain, add a DNS entry that will route the request, and execute
  the transaction, complete the following steps.
  Repeat these steps for each of
several
  domains
that you need to handle requests for, starting
  with
*.notebooks.googleapis.com
.
In
Cloud Shell
or any environment where the
Google Cloud CLI
is installed, enter the following
Google Cloud CLI
commands.
To create a private managed zone
      for one of the domains that your
      VPC network needs to handle:
gcloud
dns
managed-zones
create
ZONE_NAME
\
--visibility
=
private
\
--networks
=
https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/
PROJECT_ID
/global/networks/
NETWORK_NAME
\
--dns-name
=
DNS_NAME
\
--description
=
"Description of your managed zone"
Replace the following:
ZONE_NAME
: a name for the zone to create.
        You must use a separate zone for each domain. This zone name is used in
        each of the following steps.
PROJECT_ID
: the ID of the project that hosts your
        VPC network
NETWORK_NAME
: the name of the VPC
        network that you created earlier
DNS_NAME
: the part of the domain name that comes
        after the
*.
, with a period on the end.
        For example,
*.notebooks.googleapis.com
has a
DNS_NAME
of
notebooks.googleapis.com.
Start a transaction.
gcloud
dns
record-sets
transaction
start
--zone
=
ZONE_NAME
Add the following DNS A record. This reroutes traffic to
      Google's restricted IP addresses.
gcloud
dns
record-sets
transaction
add
\
--name
=
DNS_NAME
.
\
--type
=
A
199
.36.153.4
199
.36.153.5
199
.36.153.6
199
.36.153.7
\
--zone
=
ZONE_NAME
\
--ttl
=
300
Add the following DNS CNAME record to point to the A record
      that you just added. This redirects all traffic matching the
      domain to the IP addresses listed in the previous step.
gcloud
dns
record-sets
transaction
add
\
--name
=
\*
.
DNS_NAME
.
\
--type
=
CNAME
DNS_NAME
.
\
--zone
=
ZONE_NAME
\
--ttl
=
300
Execute the transaction.
gcloud
dns
record-sets
transaction
execute
--zone
=
ZONE_NAME
Repeat these steps for each of the following domains. For each
      repetition, change
ZONE_NAME
and
DNS_NAME
to the appropriate values for that
      domain. Keep
PROJECT_ID
and
NETWORK_NAME
the same each time. You already
      completed these steps for
*.notebooks.googleapis.com
.
*.notebooks.googleapis.com
*.notebooks.cloud.google.com
*.notebooks.googleusercontent.com
*.googleapis.com
to run code that interacts with other Google APIs
        and services
Configure the service perimeter
After
configuring the DNS records
, either
create a service
perimeter
or
update an existing
perimeter
to add your project to the service perimeter.
In the VPC network, add a route for the
199.36.153.4/30
range with a
next hop of
Default internet gateway
.
Note:
The
199.36.153.4/30
range is for
restricted.googleapis.com
to
      access APIs that are only VPC Service Controls compatible.
      If you aren't using VPC Service Controls, you can use the
199.36.153.8/30
range for
private.googleapis.com
. For more
      information about Private Google Access, see
Configure
      Private Google Access
.
Use Artifact Registry within your service perimeter
If you want to use Artifact Registry in your service perimeter,
see
Configure restricted access for GKE
private clusters
.
Use Shared VPC
If you are using
Shared VPC
,
you must add the host and the service projects to the service
perimeter. In the host project, you must also grant the
Compute Network User
(
roles/compute.networkUser
)
role to the
Notebooks Service
Agent
from the service project. For more information, see
Manage
service perimeters
.
Access your Vertex AI Workbench instance
To open a Jupyter notebook on your new instance:
In the Google Cloud console,
go to the
Instances
page.
Go to Instances
Next to your instance's name, click
Open JupyterLab
.
In JupyterLab,
select
File
>
New
>
Notebook
.
In the
Select kernel
dialog, choose a kernel,
and then click
Select
.
Your new notebook file opens.
Limitations
The following limitations apply when using VPC Service Controls with
Vertex AI Workbench:
Identity type for ingress and egress policies
When you specify an ingress or egress policy for a service perimeter,
you can't use
ANY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
or
ANY_USER_ACCOUNT
as an identity type for
all Vertex AI Workbench operations.
Instead, use
ANY_IDENTITY
as the identity type.
Accessing the Vertex AI Workbench proxy from a workstation without internet
To access Vertex AI Workbench instances
from a workstation with limited internet access,
verify with your IT administrator that you can access the following domains:
*.accounts.google.com
*.accounts.youtube.com
*.googleusercontent.com
*.kernels.googleusercontent.com
*.gstatic.com
*.notebooks.cloud.google.com
*.notebooks.googleapis.com
You must have access to these domains for authentication to
Google Cloud. See the previous section,
Configure your DNS entries using Cloud DNS
,
for further configuration information.
