Access control
This page describes how to use
Identity and Access Management (IAM)
and an access mode to manage access to
Vertex AI Workbench resources.
To manage access to
Vertex AI resources, see the
Vertex AI page on
access control
.
Vertex AI Workbench uses IAM to manage
access to instances and an access mode to manage access to
each instance's JupyterLab interface.
Control access to an instance with IAM
You can manage access to a Vertex AI Workbench instance at the
project level or per instance.
To grant access to resources at the project level, assign one or more
roles
to a principal (user, group, or
service account
).
To grant access to a specific instance, set an IAM policy
on that resource. The policy defines which roles are assigned
to which principals. To learn more, see
Manage access to
an instance
.
Access to an instance can include a broad range of abilities. For example,
you might grant a principal the ability to start, stop, and upgrade
an instance. However, even granting a principal full access to
a Vertex AI Workbench instance doesn't grant
the ability to use the instance's JupyterLab interface. See the following
section.
Control access to an instance's JupyterLab interface with the access mode
You control access to a Vertex AI Workbench instance's
JupyterLab interface through the instance's access mode.
You set a JupyterLab access mode when you create
a Vertex AI Workbench instance.
The access mode can't be changed after the notebook is created.
The JupyterLab access mode determines who can use
the instance's JupyterLab interface.
The access mode also determines which credentials are used when
your instance interacts with other Google Cloud services.
To learn more, see
Manage access to an instance's
JupyterLab interface
.
Types of IAM roles
There are different types of IAM roles that can be used in
Vertex AI Workbench:
Predefined roles
let you grant a set of related
permissions to your Vertex AI Workbench resources at the project level.
Basic roles
(Owner,
Editor, and Viewer) provide access control to your Vertex AI Workbench
resources at the project level, and are common to all Google Cloud
services.
Custom roles
enable you to choose a
specific set of permissions, create your own role with those permissions,
and grant the role to users in your organization.
To add, update, or remove these roles in your Vertex AI Workbench project,
see the documentation on
granting, changing, and
revoking access
.
Predefined Vertex AI Workbench IAM roles
Vertex AI Workbench resources are managed through the Notebooks API.
Therefore, Notebooks roles define permissions and access
to the use of Vertex AI Workbench.

Basic roles
The older Google Cloud
basic roles
are common to all Google Cloud services. These roles are Owner, Editor,
and Viewer.
The basic roles provide permissions across Google Cloud, not just for
Vertex AI Workbench. For this reason, you should
use Vertex AI Workbench roles whenever possible.
Custom roles
If the predefined IAM roles for Vertex AI Workbench
don't meet your needs, you can define custom roles. Custom roles enable you
to choose a specific set of permissions, create your own role with
those permissions, and grant the role to users in your organization.
For more information, see
Understanding
IAM custom roles
.
Project-level access versus resource-level policies
A resource inherits all policies from its
ancestry
.
A
policy
set at the resource level doesn't
affect project-level policies.  You can use project-level access and
resource-level policies to customize permissions.
For example, you can grant users
roles/notebooks.viewer
permissions
at the project level so that they can view all
Vertex AI Workbench resources in the project,
and then you can grant each user
roles/notebooks.admin
permissions
on a specific Vertex AI Workbench instance so that they
have all of the
admin
abilities to administer that instance.
Not all Vertex AI Workbench predefined roles and resources support
resource-level policies. To see which roles can be used on which resources,
view the descriptions
for each role.
Changes to the ability to access a resource take time to propagate. For more
information, see
Access change
propagation
.

a Vertex AI Workbench instance.
