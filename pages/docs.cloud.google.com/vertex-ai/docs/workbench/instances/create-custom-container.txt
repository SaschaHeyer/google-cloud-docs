Create an instance using a custom container
This page describes how to create a Vertex AI Workbench instance based on
a custom container.
Overview
Vertex AI Workbench instances support using a custom container derived
from one of the Google-provided base containers. You can modify these
base containers to make a custom container image and use these
custom containers to create a Vertex AI Workbench instance.
The base containers are configured with a
Container-Optimized
OS
in the host
virtual machine (VM). The host image is built from the
cos-stable
image family
.
Limitations
Consider the following limitations when planning your project:
The custom container must be derived from a
Google-provided base container
.
Using a container that isn't derived from a base container increases the
risk of compatibility issues and limits our ability to support your
usage of Vertex AI Workbench instances.
Use of more than one container with a Vertex AI Workbench instance
isn't supported.
Supported metadata for custom containers from
user-managed notebooks and managed notebooks can have
different behavior when used with Vertex AI Workbench instances.
The VM hosting the custom container is running off of a
Container-Optimized OS
,
which restricts how you can interact with the host machine. For example,
Container-Optimized OS doesn't include a package manager. This
means that packages acting on the host must be performed on a container
with mounts. This affects the post-startup scripts that are migrated from
managed notebooks instances and
user-managed notebooks instances, where the
host machine contains significantly more tooling than
Container-Optimized OS.
Vertex AI Workbench instances uses
nerdctl
(a containerd CLI) for running the custom container. This is required
for compatibility with the Image streaming service. Any container
parameters that are added using a metadata value need to
adhere to what is supported by
nerdctl
.
Vertex AI Workbench instances are configured to pull either
from Artifact Registry or a public container repository. To configure
an instance to pull from a private repository, you must manually
configure the credentials used by the containerd.
Base containers
Standard base container
The standard base container supports all Vertex AI Workbench features
and includes the following:
Pre-installed
data science
packages
.
Cuda libraries
similar to
Deep Learning Containers
.
Google Cloud JupyterLab integrations such as the
Dataproc
and
BigQuery
integrations.
Common system packages such as
curl
or
git
.
Metadata-based JupyterLab configuration.
Micromamba-based kernel management.
Specifications
The standard base container has the following specifications:
Base image:
nvidia/cuda:12.6.1-cudnn-devel-ubuntu24.04
Image size: Approximately 22 GB
URI:
us-docker.pkg.dev/deeplearning-platform-release/gcr.io/workbench-container:latest
Slim base container
The slim base container provides a minimal set of configurations
that permit a proxy connection to the instance. Standard
Vertex AI Workbench features and packages aren't included,
except for the following:
JupyterLab
Metadata-based JupyterLab configuration
Micromamba-based kernel management
Additional packages or JupyterLab extensions must be installed and
managed independently.
Specifications
The slim base container has the following specifications:
Base image:
marketplace.gcr.io/google/ubuntu24.04
Image size: Approximately 2 GB
URI:
us-docker.pkg.dev/deeplearning-platform-release/gcr.io/workbench-container-slim:latest

      IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
      granted a role on.
Create a project
: To create a project, you need the Project Creator
      (
roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create
permission.
Learn how to grant
      roles
.
Note
: If you don't plan to keep the
    resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
    selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
    delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector

The custom container host is provisioned to interact with
Image streaming in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE),
which pulls containers faster and reduces initialization time for
large containers once they are cached in the GKE
remote file system.
To view the requirements for enabling Image streaming, see
Requirements
.
Often, Image streaming can be used with Vertex AI Workbench instances
by enabling the Container File System API.

How the host VM runs the custom container
Instead of using Docker to run the custom container, the host VM uses
nerdctl
under the Kubernetes namespace to load and run the
container. This lets Vertex AI Workbench use
Image streaming for custom containers.

Example installation: custom container with a custom default kernel
The following example shows how to create a new kernel with a pip package
pre-installed.
Create a new custom container:
FROM us-docker.pkg.dev/deeplearning-platform-release/gcr.io/workbench-container:latest

ENV MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX=/opt/micromamba

RUN micromamba create -n
ENVIRONMENT_NAME
-c conda-forge python=
PYTHON_VERSION
-y

SHELL ["micromamba", "run", "-n", "
ENVIRONMENT_NAME
", "/bin/bash", "-c"]

RUN micromamba install -c conda-forge pip -y
RUN pip install
PACKAGE
RUN pip install ipykernel
RUN python -m ipykernel install --prefix /opt/micromamba/envs/
ENVIRONMENT_NAME
--name
ENVIRONMENT_NAME
--display-name
KERNEL_NAME
#
Creation of a micromamba kernel automatically creates a python3 kernel
#
that must be removed if it's in conflict with the new kernel.
RUN rm -rf "/opt/micromamba/envs/
ENVIRONMENT_NAME
/share/jupyter/kernels/python3"
Add the new container to Artifact Registry:
gcloud auth configure-docker
REGION
-docker.pkg.dev
docker build -t
REGION
-docker.pkg.dev/
PROJECT_ID
/
REPOSITORY_NAME
/
IMAGE_NAME
.
docker push
REGION
-docker.pkg.dev/
PROJECT_ID
/
REPOSITORY_NAME
/
IMAGE_NAME
:latest
Create an instance:
gcloud workbench instances create
INSTANCE_NAME
\
    --project=
PROJECT_ID
\
    --location=
ZONE
\
    --container-repository=
REGION
-docker.pkg.dev/
PROJECT_ID
/
REPOSITORY_NAME
/
IMAGE_NAME
\
    --container-tag=latest
Persistent kernels for custom containers
Vertex AI Workbench custom containers only mount a data disk to the
/home/
USER
directory within each container,
where
jupyter
is the default user. This means that
any change outside of
/home/
USER
is ephemeral and
won't persist after a restart. If you need installed packages to persist
for a specific kernel, you can create a kernel in the
/home/
USER
directory.
Note:
Base containers are configured with a mount point on
/home/
USER
. To create a persistent kernel
when building a custom image, you must enable Docker BuildKit.
See
Notes about specifying
volumes
.
To learn more about BuildKit, see the
BuildKit
documentation
.
To create a kernel in the
/home/
USER
directory:
Create a micromamba environment:
micromamba create -p /home/
USER
/
ENVIRONMENT_NAME
-c conda-forge python=3.11 -y
micromamba activate /home/
USER
/
ENVIRONMENT_NAME
pip install ipykernel
pip install -r ~/requirement.txt
python -m ipykernel install --prefix "/home/
USER
/
ENVIRONMENT_NAME
" --display-name "Example Kernel"
Replace the following:
USER
: the user directory name, which is
jupyter
by default
ENVIRONMENT_NAME
: the name of the environment
PYTHON_VERSION
: the Python version, for example
3.11
Wait 30 seconds to 1 minute for the kernels to refresh.
Updating the startup of the base container
The base container for a Vertex AI Workbench instance
(
us-docker.pkg.dev/deeplearning-platform-release/gcr.io/workbench-container:latest
)
starts JupyterLab by running
/run_jupyter.sh
.
If you modify the container's startup in a derivative container, you must
append
/run_jupyter.sh
to run the default configuration of JupyterLab.
The following is an example of how the Dockerfile might be modified:
#
DockerFile
FROM us-docker.pkg.dev/deeplearning-platform-release/gcr.io/workbench-container:latest

CP startup_file.sh /
#
Ensure that you have the correct permissions and startup is executable.
RUN chmod 755 /startup_file.sh && \
    chown jupyter:jupyter /startup_file.sh
#
Override the existing CMD directive from the base container.
CMD ["/startup_file.sh"]
#
/startup_file.sh

echo "Running startup scripts"
...

/run_jupyter.sh
Updating the JupyterLab Configuration within the base container
If you need to modify the JupyterLab configuration on the base
container you must do the following:
Ensure that JupyterLab is configured to port 8080. Our proxy agent is
configured to forward any request to port 8080 and if the jupyter server
isn't listening to the correct port, the instance encounters
provisioning issues.
Modify JupyterLab packages under the
jupyterlab
micromamba environment.
We provide a separate package environment to run JupyterLab and its
plugin to ensure that there aren't any dependency conflicts with the kernel
environment. If you want to install an additional JupyterLab extension,
you must install it within the
jupyterlab
environment. For example:
# DockerFile
FROM us-docker.pkg.dev/deeplearning-platform-release/gcr.io/workbench-container:latest
RUN micromamba activate jupyterlab && \
  jupyter nbextension install nbdime
Custom Container Metadata
In addition to the standard list of
metadata
that can be applied to a Vertex AI Workbench instance, instances with
custom containers include the following metadata for managing the
instantiation of the payload container:
Feature
Description
Metadata key
Accepted values and defaults
Enables Cloud Storage FUSE on a container image
Mounts
/dev/fuse
onto the container and enables
gcsfuse
for use on the container.
container-allow-fuse
true
: Enables Cloud Storage FUSE.
false
(default): Doesn't enable Cloud Storage FUSE.
Additional container run parameters
Appends additional container parameters to
nerdctl run
,
          where
nerdctl
is the Containerd CLI.
container-custom-params
A string of container run parameters. Example:
--v /mnt/disk1:/mnt/disk1
.
Additional container environment flags
Stores Environment variables into a flag under
/mnt/stateful_partition/workbench/container_env
and appends it to
nerdctl run
.
container-env-file
A string of container environment variables. Example:
CONTAINER_NAME=derivative-container
.
Upgrade a Custom Container
When your instance starts for the first time, it pulls the container image
from a URI stored in the
custom-container-payload
metadata.
If you use the
:latest
tag, the container is updated at
every restart. The
custom-container-payload
metadata value
can't be modified directly because it's a
protected metadata key
.
To update your instance's custom container image, you can use the following
methods supported by the Google Cloud CLI, Terraform, or
the Notebooks API.
gcloud
You can update the custom container image metadata on
a Vertex AI Workbench instance by using the following command:
gcloud
workbench
instances
update
INSTANCE_NAME
\
--container-repository
=
CONTAINER_URI
\
--container-tag
=
CONTAINER_TAG
Terraform
You can change the
container_image
field in the terraform configuration
to update the container payload.
To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform configuration, see
Basic Terraform commands
.

Run the diagnostic tool
The diagnostic tool checks and verifies the status of various
Vertex AI Workbench services. To learn more,
see
Tasks performed by the
diagnostic tool
.
When you create a Vertex AI Workbench instance using a custom container,
the diagnostic tool isn't available as a script in the host environment
that users can run. Instead, it is compiled into a binary and loaded onto
a Google runtime container that is built to run diagnostic services in
a Container-Optimized OS environment. See
Container-Optimized OS
Overview
.
To run the diagnostic tool, complete the following steps:
Use ssh to connect to your Vertex AI Workbench
instance
.
In the SSH terminal, run the following command:
sudo
docker
exec
diagnostic
-
service
./
diagnostic_tool
To view additional command options, run the following command:
sudo
docker
exec
diagnostic
-
service
./
diagnostic_tool
--
help
For more information about the diagnostic tool's options, see the
monitoring
health status
documentation
.
To run the diagnostic tool by using the REST API, see the
REST API
documentation
.
