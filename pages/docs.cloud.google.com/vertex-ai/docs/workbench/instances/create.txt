Create a Vertex AI Workbench instance
This page shows you how to create a Vertex AI Workbench instance by using
the Google Cloud console or the Google Cloud CLI. While creating your instance,
you can configure your instance's hardware, encryption type, network,
and other details.
Before you begin
Before you create a Vertex AI Workbench instance, you must complete
the following steps:
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
        Google Cloud,
create an account
to evaluate how our products perform in
        real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
        run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
        select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project
: Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
      IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
      granted a role on.
Create a project
: To create a project, you need the Project Creator
      (
roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create
permission.
Learn how to grant
      roles
.
Note
: If you don't plan to keep the
    resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
    selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
    delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project
.
Enable the Notebooks API.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
          role (
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin
), which
          contains the
serviceusage.services.enable
permission.

new instance. Vertex AI Workbench provides monthly cost
estimates for each machine type that you select.
GPU
: Optional. If you want GPUs, select the
GPU type
and
Number of GPUs

For more information about the command for creating an
instance from the command line, see the
gcloud CLI
documentation
.
Vertex AI Workbench creates an instance and automatically starts it.
When the instance is ready to use, Vertex AI Workbench
activates an
Open JupyterLab
link in the Google Cloud console.
Terraform
The following sample uses the
google_workbench_instance
Terraform resource to create
a Vertex AI Workbench instance
named
workbench-instance-example
.
To learn how to apply or remove a Terraform configuration, see
Basic Terraform commands
.
resource "google_workbench_instance" "default" {
  name     = "workbench-instance-example"
  location = "us-central1-a"

  gce_setup {
    machine_type = "n1-standard-1"
    accelerator_configs {
      type       = "NVIDIA_TESLA_T4"
      core_count = 1
    }
    vm_image {
      project = "cloud-notebooks-managed"
      family  = "workbench-instances"
    }
  }

JupyterLab 4 preview
Preview
      
        — JupyterLab 4
This feature is
        
        subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
        Terms
.
        
        Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
      
      For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions
.
This section describes how to change the JupyterLab version on your instance.
This section also includes limitations for you to consider when enabling
JupyterLab 4.
Change the version of JupyterLab on an existing instance
You can change your instance's JupyterLab version by using the
Google Cloud console or the gcloud CLI.
Console
To change the JupyterLab version on an existing instance,
do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Instances
page.
Go to Instances
Click the name of your instance to open the
Instance details
page.
On the
System
tab, do one of the following:
To enable the preview, select
Enable JupyterLab 4 preview
.
To turn off the preview and use JupyterLab 3, clear
Enable JupyterLab 4 preview
.
Click
Submit
.
Reset your
instance
.
gcloud
You can change the JupyterLab version on an existing instance by using
the following command:
gcloud
workbench
instances
update
INSTANCE_NAME
\
--project
=
"
PROJECT_ID
"
\
--location
=
"
LOCATION
"
\
--metadata
=
enable-jupyterlab4-preview
=
ENABLEMENT_BOOLEAN
Replace the following:
PROJECT_ID
: your project ID
LOCATION
: the zone where you want
    your instance to be located
INSTANCE_NAME
: the name of your
    Vertex AI Workbench instance
ENABLEMENT_BOOLEAN
: use one of the following:
true
: enables the JupyterLab 4 preview
false
: turns off the JupyterLab 4 preview and
        changes to JupyterLab 3
Limitations
Consider the following limitations when enabling the JupyterLab 4 preview:
Integrations with Google Cloud services such as BigQuery
and Cloud Storage aren't supported during preview.
Enabling JupyterLab 4 in a custom container-based instance is supported. See
the
limitations for using custom containers with
Vertex AI Workbench
.
Network configuration options
A Vertex AI Workbench instance must access service endpoints
that are outside your VPC network.
You can provide this access in one of the following ways:
Assign an external IP address to
the instance. This is done by default when you create
a new instance. Make sure your
environment meets the
requirements for accessing Google APIs and
services
.
Connect the instance to a subnet where
Private Google Access
is enabled.
Make sure your environment meets the
requirements for
Private Google Access
.
If you use the
private.googleapis.com
or
restricted.googleapis.com
VIP to
provide access to the service endpoints,
add DNS entries for each of the required service
endpoints
:
notebooks.googleapis.com
*.notebooks.cloud.google.com
*.notebooks.googleusercontent.com
*.kernels.googleusercontent.com
For an instance with
third party credentials
, add a DNS entry for the following:
*.byoid.googleusercontent.com
Network tags
Your new Vertex AI Workbench instance automatically has the
deeplearning-vm
and
notebook-instance
network tags
assigned.
These tags let you manage network access to and from
your Vertex AI Workbench instance by referencing the tags in your
VPC networking firewall rules. For more information about
network tags, see
Add network tags
.
To view the network tags for a Vertex AI Workbench instance,
do the following:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
VM instances
page.
Go to VM instances
Click the name of the instance.
In the
Networking
section, find
Network tags
.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter a problem when you create an instance, see
Troubleshooting
Vertex AI Workbench
for help with common issues.
