Schedule a notebook run
This page shows you how to use
the Vertex AI Workbench executor
to run a Python notebook file on an hourly schedule.
Before you begin
Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to
        Google Cloud,
create an account
to evaluate how our products perform in
        real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to
        run, test, and deploy workloads.
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page,
          select or create a Google Cloud project.
Roles required to select or create a project
Select a project
: Selecting a project doesn't require a specific
      IAM role—you can select any project that you've been
      granted a role on.
Create a project
: To create a project, you need the Project Creator
      (
roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator
), which contains the
resourcemanager.projects.create
permission.
Learn how to grant
      roles
.
Note
: If you don't plan to keep the
    resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of
    selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can
    delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector
Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project
.
Enable the Notebooks and Vertex AI APIs.
Roles required to enable APIs
To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM
          role (
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin
), which
          contains the
serviceusage.services.enable
permission.
Learn how to grant
          roles

), which
          contains the
serviceusage.services.enable
permission.
Learn how to grant
          roles
.
Enable the APIs
Required roles
To ensure that your instance's service account has the necessary
      permissions to interact with the Vertex AI Workbench executor,
    
      ask your administrator to grant your instance's service account the
    following IAM roles on the project:
Important:
You must grant these roles
      to your instance's service account,
not
to your user account. Failure to grant the roles to the correct principal might result in permission errors.
Notebooks Runner
(
roles/notebooks.runner
)
Storage Admin
(
roles/storage.admin
)
For more information about granting roles, see
Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations
.
Your administrator might also be able to give your instance's service account
        the required permissions through
custom
        roles
or other
predefined
        roles
.
Create an instance and example notebook file
Create an
instance
.
Open JupyterLab
.
Open a new notebook
file
.
In the first cell of the notebook file, enter the following:
# Import datetime
import
datetime
# Get the time and print it
datetime
.
datetime
.
now
()
print
(
datetime
.
datetime
.
now
())
To make sure your notebook file is saved, select
File
>
Save Notebook
.
Schedule a run
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Instances
page.
Go to Instances
Next to your instance's name,
click
Open JupyterLab
.
Your Vertex AI Workbench instance opens JupyterLab.
In the
folder
File Browser
,
double-click the example notebook file to open it.
Click the
Execute
button.
In the
Submit notebooks to Executor
dialog, in the
Type
field,
select
Schedule-based recurring executions
.
By default, the executor runs your notebook file
every hour at the
00
minute of the hour.
In
Advanced options
,
enter a name for your bucket in the
Cloud Storage bucket
field,
and then click
Create and select
.
The executor stores your notebook output
in the Cloud Storage bucket.
Click
Submit
.
Your notebook file runs automatically
on the schedule that you set.
Note:
If your instance is shut down, the
executor still runs your notebook file on schedule.
When you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid
   continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see
Clean up
.
View, share, and import an executed notebook file
By using your instance's JupyterLab interface,
you can view your notebook output, share the results with others,
and import the executed notebook file into JupyterLab.
Note:
To use the Google Cloud console to view and share execution results,
on the
Executions
page,
click
View result
.
View the execution results
In JupyterLab's navigation menu, click the
Notebook Executor
button.
Click the
Executions
tab.
Under the execution that you want to view, click
View result
.
The executor opens your result in a new browser tab.
Share the execution results
In your instance's
JupyterLab user interface,
in the navigation menu, click the
Notebook Executor
button.
Click the
Executions
tab.
Next to the execution that you want to share,
click the
more_vert
options menu,
and select
Share execution result
.
Follow the directions in the dialog
to grant users access to the execution result.
Import the executed notebook into JupyterLab
In your instance's
JupyterLab user interface,
in the navigation menu, click the
Notebook Executor
button.
Click the
Executions
tab.
Next to the execution that you want to import,
click the
more_vert
options menu,
and select
Import executed notebook
.
If the
Select Kernel
dialog appears,
select the kernel that you want to open the notebook.
The executor opens the executed notebook file
in JupyterLab, and stores this notebook file in
the JupyterLab File Browser in a folder named
imported_notebook_jobs
.
View or delete a schedule
You can view and delete schedules by using either the Google Cloud console or
your instance's JupyterLab user interface.
View a schedule
View a schedule to see the frequency settings of the schedule
or to view the five most recent results of the notebook file execution.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Schedules
page.
Go to Schedules
For the schedule that you want to view,
click its schedule name.
On the
Schedule details
page, you can view the schedule's last
five executions.
Next to an execution name, click
View result
to open
the executed notebook file.
The executor opens your result in a new browser tab.
JupyterLab
In your instance's
JupyterLab user interface,
in the navigation menu, click the
Notebook Executor
button.
Click the
Schedules
tab.
Under the execution that you want to view, click
View latest
execution result
.
The executor opens your result in a new browser tab.
Delete a schedule
Deleting a schedule doesn't delete the executions that were
generated from that schedule.
Console
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Schedules
page.
Go to Schedules
Select the schedule that you want to delete.
Click
delete
Delete
.
JupyterLab
In your instance's
JupyterLab user interface,
in the navigation menu, click the
Notebook Executor
button.
Click the
Schedules

Schedule details
page
for that schedule opens in the Google Cloud console.
Click
delete
Delete
.
Clean up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for
          the resources used on this page, follow these steps.
Delete the instance
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Instances
page.
Go to Instances
Select the instance that you want to delete.
Click
delete
Delete
.
Delete the project
If you used resources outside of
your Vertex AI Workbench instance,
such as the Cloud Storage bucket required
for creating a schedule,
you might want to delete your project to avoid incurring additional charges.
Caution
: Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted.
If you used an existing project for
      the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've
      done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost.
When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in
      the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an
appspot.com
URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects
    can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.
In the Google Cloud console, go to the
Manage resources
page.
Go to Manage resources
In the project list, select the project that you
    want to delete, and then click
Delete
.
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click
Shut down
to delete the project.
