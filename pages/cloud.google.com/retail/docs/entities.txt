Entities
This page introduces
entities
, ways of capturing varied user behavior depending on multiple brands or products on a single enterprise site, as well as how and why they can be used.
For most use cases, entities are not needed for Vertex AI Search for commerce. However,
retailers who serve multiple brands or regions from a single product
catalog can get better results if they use entities.
Overview
Setting up multiple entities in your project is a way to take into consideration
different behavior and preferences of shoppers who are in different regions or
countries or who shop at differently branded sites that belong to your
enterprise.
Example use case: two countries
A retailer, Example Organization, has a web presence in both the US and Canada.
Example Organization wants to serve browse and search results and autocomplete
suggestions that take into account differences between the shoppers in the two
countries. And so, Example Organization designates two entities:
org_us
and
org_ca
.
User events are tagged with an entity value, depending on which website the
shopper visited (
.com
or
ca
). When a shopper makes a search request, the
entity value is included in the request.
The two countries have important but different holidays in July. With entities
set up, when shoppers search the Example Organization site for
July
,
American shoppers are served Fourth of July themed items first and Canadian
shoppers receive items themed for Canada Day.
Similarly, recommendations for Canadian shoppers are more likely to show Canada
Day items than Fourth of July items.
Example use case: an acquisition
Enterprise Example Organization recently acquired Startup Example Organization.
The catalogs have been combined but the Startup brand and website is being
kept because it has a loyal following.
The enterprise creates an entity,
startup
, to tag user events originating from
the Startup site. This allows the search, browse, autocomplete, and
recommendation suggestions that are served to the Startup site to take into
account the preferences of the Startup site's shoppers.
Multiple projects or multiple entities?
When you set up Vertex AI Search for commerce, you can use different projects or different
entities in the same project to get different suggestions for your different
shopper populations.
For some applications, separate projects are required. For other applications,
setting up entities is the better solution.
Use
entities
when you have:
A fully or partially shared catalog between the entities
One or more of the following:
Multiple brands in the same country or language area—for example, you have
your original brand and an acquired brand,
google_home
and
nest
.
Multiple regions in the same country—for example,
enterprise_east
and
enterprise_west
.
One brand but in multiple countries with the same language—for example,
brand_us
and
brand_ca
.
Use
separate projects
instead of entities when you have:
Catalogs that cannot be combined or catalogs that, if combined, have little or no overlap.
Entities that require different languages.
Only one language is allowed per project.
User events and entities
To take advantage of the entities feature, add the entity field to your
user events.
For search and autocomplete:
include the
entity
field
 in user events of type
search
.
Including the entity field in other user event types can be helpful
for troubleshooting but does not affect the quality of the search or
autocomplete responses.
For recommendations:
include the entity field in as many types of user
event as you can.
Typically, it takes 30 to 90 days of user event data before the entity feature 
returns optimal suggestions.
If an entity is missing from a request, the request makes no assumption about the
entity in the result. You'll get an average result that is based on user events
with and without the entity specified.
Search and entities
To get search or browse results that take into account the entity:
Include the
entity
field in your search user events
(
eventType="search"
).
For an example, see the complete object example for the
Search
user event.
Add the
entity
field to your search request. For information about how to
make search requests, see
Get search results
.
Autocomplete and entities
To get autocomplete results that take into account the entity:
Follow the instructions in
Auto-learning dataset
and
Suggestion filtered by entity
.
Recommendations and entities
After you have added the
entity
field to your user events, no
further action is required to take advantage of entities for recommendations.
This is because the entity value is part of the user event, which, in turn, is
included in the call to the
predict
method.
