About serving controls
You can apply serving controls to
serving configs
to customize how
search treats search queries and returns results. A serving
control is a rule consisting of a condition-action pair, where the condition
dictates when the serving control will execute, and the action specifies what
behavior the serving control will enact.
You can create a serving control by using the API
Control.create
method.
If you don't want to use the API, you can choose
console
for creating serving controls in Vertex AI Search for commerce.
Available serving controls
The following serving controls are available:
Boost/bury
: Affects result ranking and order in the
returned result list. Available for search and
recommendations.
Filter
: Removes results that don't pass the filter from the
returned result list. Available for search only.
Redirect
: Redirects your users to a specific page depending
on the search query. Available for search only.
Pinning
: Exact position in the results is specified for a
certain product.
Linguistic
: Customizes search query linguistics. Available
for search only. Several types of linguistic controls are
available:
Synonym
: Expands considered synonyms for a search query.
One-way synonym
: Expands considered synonyms
unidirectionally for specific terms.
Ignore
: Prevents a term from being used in searches.
Do not associate
: Prevent terms from
being used in searches when specific terms appear.
Replacement
: Replaces terms in the search query.
Control conditions
Control conditions dictate when a serving control will execute.
Control condition fields can be query terms, time ranges, or both. Some control
types allow multiple condition fields, or don't allow any.
The condition fields available:
Query terms
: Triggered when the term appears in the search query.
A full match requires the entire search query to match the query term.
Multiple query terms can be specified. Triggers as long as one of the query
terms appears in the search query.
Active time range
: Triggered when the date of the search query is in the
time range.
Multiple time ranges can be specified. Triggers as long as date of query is
within the time range (inclusive).
The condition fields that you specify determine whether the control will be
applied.
Multiple condition fields
are combined using AND. This means
that if you specify both time range and query terms, both condition fields
need to be triggered for the control to apply.
Multiple condition sub-fields
are combined using OR. This means that if
you have multiple query terms the query terms will be triggered if any one
query term matches. If you have multiple time ranges, any one time range that
matches will trigger the control.
No condition fields
specified mean the control always applies. However,
some controls require a field to be defined.
For more about condition settings, see the
Controls.condition
API reference
.
Control actions
A control action specifies what behavior the serving control will enact if the
conditions are met during a search.
What kind of action you can specify depends on the type of serving control you
create. For example, the action for a boost/bury control is to apply a
boost/bury value to products that the filter you specify, while the action for a
one-way synonym control is to apply an associated term that you specify.
Boost/bury controls
Boost/bury controls enable you to show certain search results as
higher or lower in ranking.
You can create a boost/bury control for search or
recommendations. Boost/bury for recommendations is
in Public Preview.
When creating a boost/bury control, you can use filter expressions to specify
the conditions based on
Product
fields.
For search filters, use the filter expression syntax
documented in
Filter and order results
.
For recommendations filters, use the filter expression syntax
documented in
Filter recommendations
.
You can then apply a
boost
value between -1.0 and 1.0 to indicate how much to
boost or bury product results matching those conditions. A positive value boosts
the results, and a negative value buries them.
Setting a high boost strength gives the item a large promotion, but doesn't
necessarily mean that the boosted item will be the top result at all times.
Results that are significantly more relevant to the search query can still trump
heavily favored but irrelevant items. Likewise, setting the boost strength to
-1.0 would give the item a large demotion, but results that are deeply relevant
might still be shown.
As an example of using boost/bury, you could prioritize cheaper products and
deprioritize the expensive ones.
Control conditions differ between search and
recommendations boost/bury controls:
Search: You can set query terms and applicable time ranges
as the control conditions.
Recommendations: Control conditions aren't available. The
control always applies.
As a control action, specify a filter for products to boost or bury, and set the
boost/bury value.
To create a boost/bury control, see
Create a new serving control
.
For more about boost/bury control settings, see the
Controls.BoostAction
API reference
.
Filter controls
With filter controls, you can dynamically add predefined filters based on a
specific search request.
You can use filter expressions based on
Product
fields. See
Filter and order results
for the filter expression syntax.
You can set query terms and applicable time ranges as the control conditions. As
a control action, specify a filter to apply at query time.
For example, given the query
blue shoes
, you can use a filter control to automatically filter search results on the color blue. You can also use filter
controls to prevent certain results from being returned to shoppers.
To create a filter control, see
Create a new serving control
.
For more about filter control settings, see the
Controls.FilterAction
API reference
.
Redirect controls
You can use a redirect control to redirect your shoppers to different pages
based on their intent, instead of only showing them search results.
You can set query terms and applicable time ranges as the control conditions. As
a control action, specify a redirect URI to redirect to if the conditions are
matched.
For example, you could create a redirect control so that during a promotion for
a the product
gShoe
, queries with
running shoes
or
sports
shoes redirects to the gShoe product page. Another case for using redirect controls would be to redirect shoppers to a specific page if they search for a term that is not relevant to your site, such as a search for
FAQ
redirecting the user to the actual Frequently Asked Questions page on your site instead of showing search results.
To create a redirect control, see
Create a new serving control
.
For more about redirect control settings, see the
Controls.RedirectAction
API reference
.
Pinning controls
Pinning controls let you specify an exact position in the results you want a certain product to appear.
You can create a pinning control for search or browse. It is not supported for recommendations.
When creating a pinning control, you can use filter expressions to specify
the conditions based on
Product
fields.
As a control action, add a
Rule
to your search or browse
Condition
which will be the action field
pin_action.
You can then apply a
pin
value between [1,120]  to indicate the fixed position to pin the results to matching those conditions given.
Rule Condition
: Must specify non-empty
[Condition.query_terms][]
(for search only) or
[Condition.page_categories][]
(for browse only), but not both.
Action Input
:
[pin_position, product_id]
pairs are mapped (the input position can be a value from 1 to 120). The maximum size is the maximum request page size. 10 is the number of allowed pairs in the pin map.
Action Result
: Pin products with matching IDs to the position specified in the final result order.
To name an example, suppose the query is
shoes
, the
[Condition.query_terms][]
is
"shoes"
and the
pin_map
has
{1
,
pid1}
. The product with
pid1
is pinned to the top position in the final results.
Note:
A query with an active pin experiences 100ms of added latency.
Enabling pins and applied rules
When a pinning control is enabled:
Products with product IDs which match a pin appear in the final response in the exact position specified by the control.
Pins to the second page or later (higher page number) are not allowed, that is, any pin that is set to a position higher than the request
page_size
is ignored.
A maximum of 10 products can be pinned with one control.
The
product_id
must be the ID of an existing product in the catalog.
The product is always recalled in every search and appears on the page unless:
Filters and sorting are applied. These prevent pins from appearing.
The sort order (such as having the search results sorted by price) is not the default.
Pin behavior
If a product is pinned, it will ignore any
boosts or buries
from the request or from other controls.
If a product is pinned to multiple positions, the most recently updated control takes precedence.
Two products cannot be pinned to the same position inside the same pinning control (pin map).
If multiple controls match the same query and each of those have a different pin for the same product ID, the
[pin_pos, p_id]
pair from the most recently updated control takes precedence.
Caution:
Adding pinning controls to many common queries can adversely impact your total latency. Use sparingly and only when necessary.
Linguistic controls
You can create additions or overrides to how words are treated for certain queries.
Synonym controls
Setting two words as synonyms is a linguistic control that associates two words.
Synonym controls add additional context to a search query. They don't force a
result to be included in the search results, but they can help the system
include additional products in the search results, making it more likely that a
given result is included. In other words, synonym controls can encourage the
search result to consider more options, but ultimately the search result will be
dependent on scoring.
For example, if you want search results for
running shoes
to also include
sport shoes
, create a linguistic synonym control. The condition is that
running shoes
is entered as the search term. The action is to include the synonym
sport shoes
with that search. So when a shopper on your site searches
running shoes
, search finds that match in the linguistic control you created, expanding it to include
sport shoes
when it returns search results to the shopper.
To create a synonym control, see
Create a new serving control
.
Two-way synonym controls
Use two-way synonym controls to link several terms together so that
search treats them the same during searches.
You can set query terms and applicable time ranges as the control conditions.
You don't need to set a separate control action; if a term you specified is
used as a query, the control action is to use other terms you specified as the
synonyms.
For example, you could set a two-way synonym control that associates the terms
dish towel
and
kitchen towel
as synonyms. When a shopper on your site enters
kitchen towel
as a query, search can then expand the query to
include results for
dish towel
and
kitchen towel
.
To create a synonym control, see
Create a new serving control
.
Synonyms don't change the original query. For example, if queries A and B are a two-way synonym, expect the following effect:
Query A results returned
: Set A (with no synonym rule applied) and some of set B. However, the results might be less than the combination of A and B.
Query B results returned
: Set B and some of A, but possibly less than the sum of result sets A and B.
For more about two-way synonym control settings, see the
Controls.TwowaySynonymsAction
API reference.
One-way synonym controls
One-way synonym controls expand query terms to link terms together unidirectionally.
You can set query terms and applicable time ranges as the control conditions. As
a control action, specify the terms to use as one-way synonyms.
For example, you could set a one-way synonym control that expands searches for
the term
rose
to include the term
pink
. Because it is a one-way synonym,
searches for the term
pink
don't expand to include the term
rose
.
To create a one-way synonym control, see
Create a new serving control
.
Note that just as with two-way synonyms, the original query is executed and the synonyms are provided as hints to that query. Synonyms for entirely different words may only result in small numbers of the synonym terms being included in the results. The preceding example returns pink items with an emphasis on pink roses, but a synonym rule expanding searches for the term
dog
to include
cat
returns mostly items with dogs, plus some with cats.
For more about one-way synonym control settings, see the
Controls.OnewaySynonymsAction
API reference
.
Synonyms don't provide identical results
Search results for two synonyms aren't always identical.
For example, if you set
laptop bags
and
luggage
as two-way synonyms,
the system might already associate
suitcase
with
luggage
. So, when a user
searches for
luggage
, Vertex AI Search for commerce returns results about
luggage
,
suitcase
, and
laptop bags
. However, when you search for
laptop bags
,
Vertex AI Search for commerce only adds
luggage
to the synonyms. So the results
might not contain
suitcase
.
Ignore controls
Ignore controls prevent search from using certain query terms
during searches. They mark ignored terms in a query as not important, but does not exclude them from the query entirely.
To completely remove a search term from a query, use a
replacement
control
. While a
filter control
affects which results
are shown, a replacement control is a more robust way to prevent
Vertex AI Search for commerce from returning results for a specific term.
An ignore control doesn't guarantee that results for the ignored term won't be returned in a Vertex AI Search for commerce results. For example, an ignore control for the word
oil
could still return oil paints for a query of
oil paints.
The query will be passed as
paints,
and there may be many oil paints matched, but the result set will be larger as the search is for
paints.
This type of control might be useful if
oil paints
were a popular query on your site and you sell many different types of paints, but not many oil-based paints.
You can set query terms and applicable time ranges as the control conditions.
You don't need to set a separate control action; if a term you specified is
used as a query, the control action is to ignore that term.
For example, you could create a control that ignores query terms that use
offensive language.
To create an ignore control, see
Create a new serving control
.
For more about ignore control settings, see the
Controls.IgnoreAction
API reference
.
Do-not-associate controls
Do-not-associate controls suppress certain search terms from being associated with other specified ones. This won't necessarily affect the search results, but it can.
Use a given query term and applicable time ranges for your control conditions.
As a control action, specify which terms
shouldn't
be associated with the
query terms.
Example: You create a control that prevents a brand name (such as
gShoe
) from grouping with
cheap
and
poor quality
in a
query. A shopper searches for
poor quality cheap gShoe
. Search removes the query terms
cheap
and
poor quality
from the initial query, with the resulting query term being
gShoe.
However, this does not guarantee that it is entirely removed from the search results.
If a relevant query term also contains a term specified as do-not-associate, that relevant result might still be returned. To prevent this
from happening entirely, use a
filter
control.
To create a do-not-associate control, see
Create a new serving control
.
For more about do-not-associate control settings, see the
Controls.DoNotAssociateAction
API reference
.
Replacement controls
Replacement controls replace one or more given query terms with a different term
that you specify. You can specify multiple terms that can be mapped to single
term (but not vice versa).
You can set query terms and applicable time ranges as the control conditions. As
a control action, specify the term that should be used as a replacement.
For example, you could create a control that replaces nicknames for a brand with
the full brand name that is more commonly used in product descriptions.
To create a replacement control in the Search for commerce console, see
Create a new serving control
.
For more about replacement control settings, see the
Controls.ReplacementAction
API reference
.
