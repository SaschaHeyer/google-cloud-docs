General guidance on conducting A/B experiments
This page describes how you can use A/B experiments to understand how
Vertex AI Search for commerce is impacting your business.
Overview
An
A/B experiment
is a randomized
experiment with two groups: an experimental group and a control group. The
experimental group receives some different treatment (in this case, predictions
or search results from Vertex AI Search for commerce); the control group does not.
When you run an A/B experiment, you include the
information about which group a user was in when you record user events.
That information is used to refine the model and provide
metrics.
Both versions of your application must be the same, except that users in the
experimental group see results generated by Vertex AI Search for commerce and
the control group does not. You log user events for both groups.
For more on traffic splitting, see
Splitting Traffic
in the App Engine documentation.
Experiment platforms
Set up the experiment using a third-party experiment platform such as
VWO
,
AB Tasty
. The control and experimental groups
each get a unique experiment ID from the platform. When you record a user event,
specify which group the user is in by including the experiment ID in the
experimentIds
field. Providing the experiment ID lets
you to compare the metrics for the versions of your
application seen by the control and experimental groups.
Best practices for A/B experiments
The goal of an A/B experiment is to accurately determine the impact of updating
your site (in this case, employing Vertex AI Search for commerce). To get an accurate measure
of the impact, you must design and implement the experiment correctly, so that
other differences don't creep in and impact the experiment results.
To design a meaningful A/B experiment, use the following tips:
Before setting up your A/B experiment, use prediction or search preview to
ensure that your model is behaving as you expect.
Make sure that the behavior of your site is identical for the experimental
group and the control group.
Site behavior includes latency, display format, text format, page layout,
image quality, and image size. There should be no discernible differences
for any of these attributes between the experience of the control and
experiment groups.
Accept and display results as they are returned from
Vertex AI Search for commerce, and display them in the same order as they are
returned.
Filtering out items that are out of stock is acceptable. However, you should
avoid filtering or ordering results based on your business
rules.
If you are using search user events and include the required attribution token with them, make sure they are
set up correctly. See the documentation for
Attribution tokens
.
Make sure that the serving config you provide when you request
recommendations or search results matches your intention for that
recommendation or search result, and the location where you display the
results.
When you use recommendations, the serving config
affects how models are trained and therefore what products are recommended.

.
If you are comparing an existing solution with Vertex AI Search for commerce,
keep the experience of the control group strictly segregated from the
experience of the experimental group.
If the control solution does not provide a recommendation or search result,
don't provide one from Vertex AI Search for commerce in the control pages.
Doing so will skew your test results.
Make sure your users don't switch between the control group and the
experiment group. This is especially important within the same session, but
also recommended across sessions. This improves experiment performance and
helps you get statistically significant A/B test results sooner.
