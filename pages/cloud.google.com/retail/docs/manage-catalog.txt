Manage catalog information
This page describes how to manage your product information after you have
imported a catalog into Vertex AI Search for commerce. You can read, write, and

To keep your catalog up to date as product information changes, import your

catalog, see
Importing catalog information
.

Upload a single product item
curl
Create a single product item by using the
products.create
REST method.
curl
-X
POST
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer
$(
gcloud
auth
application-default
print-access-token
)
"
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8"
\
--data
'{
"title": "
PRODUCT_TITLE
",
"categories": "
CATEGORY
"
}'
\
"https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/
PROJECT_NUMBER
/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0/products?productId=
PRODUCT_ID
"
If the request is successful, the product object is returned, such as in the
following example.
{
"name"
:
"projects/
PROJECT_NUMBER
/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0/products/
PRODUCT_ID
"
,
"id"
:
"
PRODUCT_ID
"
,
"primaryProductId"
:
"
PRODUCT_ID
"
,
"type"
:
"PRIMARY"
,
"categories"
:
\[
"
CATEGORY
"
\]
,
"title"
:
"
PRODUCT_TITLE
"
,
"availability"
:
"IN_STOCK"
}
Java
public
static
Product
createProduct
(
Product
productToCreate
,
String
productId
)
throws
IOException
{
return
getProductServiceClient
().
createProduct
(
DEFAULT_BRANCH_NAME
,
productToCreate
,
productId
);
}
Update product information
As your product catalog changes, you can refresh your catalog by uploading
changes in products such as new products, prices, and stock status in real
time. You can upload only products that have been added or changed; you don't need to reload your entire catalog.
curl
Update product information by using the
products.patch
method.
The following example updates the title for a specific product:
curl
-X
PATCH
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer
$(
gcloud
auth
application-default
print-access-token
)
"
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8"
\
--data
"{
"
title
": "
new-title-value
"
}"
\
"https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/
PROJECT_NUMBER
/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0/products/
PRODUCT_ID
?updateMask=title"
If the request is successful, the product object is returned, such as in the
following example.
{
"name"
:
"projects/
PROJECT_NUMBER
/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0/products/
PRODUCT_ID
"
,
"id"
:
"
PRODUCT_ID
"
,
"primaryProductId"
:
"
PRODUCT_ID
"
,
"type"
:
"PRIMARY"
,
"categories"
:
\[
"Parent category > Child category"
\]
,
"title"
:
"new product title"
,
"availability"
:
"IN_STOCK"
}
Java
public
static
Product
updateProduct
(
Product
productToUpdate
)
throws
IOException
{
return
getProductServiceClient
().
updateProduct
(
productToUpdate
,
FieldMask
.
getDefaultInstance
());
}
Delete product information
Although the API provides a way to delete products from your
catalog, keep in mind that if you record a user event that relates to a product
item that has been deleted, the API cannot process the user
event properly and it might be deleted. In addition, including historical
catalog data improves the quality of your model and is critical for good
recommendations and search results.
You should set the
availability
of obsolete products to
OUT_OF_STOCK
rather than deleting them.
curl
Delete a product by using the
delete
method, replacing
PRODUCT_ID
with the ID of the product you want to
delete.
curl
-X
DELETE
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer
$(
gcloud
auth
application-default
print-access-token
)
"
\
"https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/
PROJECT_NUMBER
/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0/products/
PRODUCT_ID
"
Java
public
static
void
deleteProduct
(
String
productName
)
throws
IOException
{
getProductServiceClient
().
deleteProduct
(
productName
);
}
Retrieve a product item
curl
You retrieve a product item by making a
GET
request to the
products
endpoint, replacing
PRODUCT_ID
with the ID
of the product you want to retrieve:
curl
-X
GET
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer
$(
gcloud
auth
application-default
print-access-token
)
"
\
"https://retail.googleapis.com/v2/projects/
PROJECT_NUMBER
/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0/products/
PRODUCT_ID
"
You should see output similar to the following:
{
"name"
:
"projects/
PROJECT_NUMBER
/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/0/products/
PRODUCT_ID
"
"id"
:
"
PRODUCT_ID
"
,
"primaryProductId"
:
"
PRODUCT_ID
"
,
"type"
:
"PRIMARY"
,
"categories"
:
\
[
"Parent category > Child category"
\
],
"title"
:
"product title"
,
"availability"
:
"IN_STOCK"
}
Java
public
static
Product
getProduct
(
String
productName
)
throws
IOException
{
return
getProductServiceClient
().
getProduct
(
productName
);
}
View aggregated information about your catalog
You can view aggregated information about your catalog and preview uploaded
products under the
Catalog
tab in the
Data
page of the Search for commerce console.
Assess catalog data quality
To assess the quality of your catalog data:
Go to the
Data quality
page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Data quality page
The
Data quality
page
assesses if you need to update catalog data to improve the quality of your
search results and unlock search performance tiers.
For more about how to check search data quality and view search performance
tiers, see
Unlock search performance tiers
.
For a summary of available catalog metrics, see
Catalog quality metrics
.
Change product types
When importing a product, you can specify if the product's type is primary,
variant, or a collection. If a product's type changes or was specified
incorrectly, you must
delete the product
and
create it
it
with the updated type specified.
A product's type can be set to
TYPE_UNSPECIFIED
,
PRIMARY
,
VARIANT
, or
COLLECTION
. For more details, see
product.Type
in the
reference documentation.
Change product level configuration
Deprecated:
The Merchant Center connector is deprecated and only
available to current users. New users must use the Catalog API or BigQuery to
import catalogs. Only customers with prior access can use the feature. If you're an existing customer and have access to Merchant Center, then continue reading.
To import a catalog with Merchant Center, you must specify
if the products are primaries or variants.
If the
product levels
change or were specified incorrectly, use this
procedure to correct their configuration. You must have the
Retail Admin
IAM role to complete this procedure.
Make sure no imports are occurring while you reconfigure the product
levels. This verifies that data does not get uploaded at the wrong level.
Delete all product items. See
products.delete
.
The catalog must be completely empty before proceeding to the next step.
Re-import your data to change the product level configuration.
This procedure depends on how you import. Follow the appropriate procedure in
Import Catalog Information
to set the product levels to
their new configuration.
Finish importing the new catalog with the modified level configuration, using
your chosen procedure in
Import Catalog Information
.
Tune all existing models.
To tune a model, go to the
Models page
, click the model
name to view its details page, then click
Manual Tune
in the button bar.
Go to the Models page
For tuning cost details, see
Pricing
