Manage serving configs
This page describes how to delete, edit, and list serving configs, as
well as review statistics about each configuration.
For help with creating a new serving config, see
Create serving configs
.
It is not necessary to configure a serving config for search to work. Any
serving_config_id
can be placed as part of the search request, in which case, it defaults to an empty or non-configured serving control. The catalog is then searched with Vertex AI Search for commerce default search capability.
If you have existing placements, or create new placements, Vertex AI Search for commerce
automatically creates a serving config associated
with each placement. Creating a serving config does not create a
corresponding placement. Deleting a serving config deletes its
corresponding placement, and deleting a placement deletes its corresponding
serving config.
Edit serving configs
You can edit serving configs using the Search for commerce console
or the API.
Note:
If you are making significant changes to a a serving config that contains
a Page-Level Optimization model, the Page-Level Optimization model might return suboptimal results while it is
retraining. Because it can take a long time to retrain the Page-Level Optimization model,
consider recreating the Page-Level Optimization model and its associated serving config.
Edit serving configs in the console
You can see and edit the controls for each serving config on the
Serving Configs page
. Click a
serving config to see its
Details
page, which lists all serving and
site-wide controls for that configuration.
On this page, you can edit controls, create new controls, or apply existing
controls to the configuration.
It takes a few minutes for newly created or updated serving configs to
be ready to serve live traffic. You can test changes right away on the
Evaluate
page
.
Edit serving configs inline
You can update serving config fields, add serving controls, and remove
serving controls inline using API methods.
Patch serving configs inline
To update fields in a serving config, use
ServingConfig.patch
and include an instance of
ServingConfig
in the request body. Specify the
fields to update with the
updateMask
parameter, or leave it unset to update
all supported fields.
For more about this method, see the
ServingConfig.patch
API reference
.
curl
-X
PATCH
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer
$(
gcloud
auth
application-default
print-access-token
)
"
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8"
\
-d

?updateMask=
FIELD_NAME_1
,
FIELD_NAME_2
'
Add controls to serving configs inline
To add a control to a serving config, use
ServingConfig.addControl
.
The control is added in the last position of the list of controls it belongs to.
For example, a
facetSpec
control is applied in the last position of
servingConfig.facetSpecIds
.
For more about this method, see the
ServingConfig.addControl
API reference
.
curl
-X
POST
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer
$(
gcloud
auth
application-default
print-access-token
)
"
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8"
\
-d
'{
"controlID": "
CONTROL_ID
"
}'
\
'https://retail.googleapis.com/v2beta/projects/
PROJECT_NUMBER
/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/servingConfigs/
SERVING_CONFIG_ID
:addControl'
Remove controls from serving configs inline
To remove a control from a serving config, use
ServingConfig.removeControl
.
For more about this method, see the
ServingConfig.removeControl
API reference
.
curl
-X
POST
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer
$(
gcloud
auth
application-default
print-access-token
)
"
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8"
\
-d
'{
"controlID": "
CONTROL_ID
"
}'
\
'https://retail.googleapis.com/v2beta/projects/
PROJECT_NUMBER
/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/servingConfigs/
SERVING_CONFIG_ID
:removeControl'
View serving configs

or the API.
View serving configs in the console
You can see all of your serving configs on the
Serving Configs page
.
View serving configs inline
To see a single serving config inline, use
ServingConfig.get

For more about this method, see the
ServingConfig.get
API reference
.
curl

application-default
print-access-token
)
"
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8"
\
'https://retail.googleapis.com/v2beta/projects/
PROJECT_NUMBER
/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/servingConfigs/
SERVING_CONFIG_ID
'
To list all serving configs inline, use
ServingConfig.list
.
Optionally, you can use the parameter
pageSize
to set a maximum number of
results to return. If more results are available, the
list
response includes a
page token. You can pass a page token in the
pageToken
parameter of a
list
request to retrieve the next page of results.
For more about this method, see the
ServingConfig.list
API reference
.
curl
-X
GET
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer
$(
gcloud
auth
application-default
print-access-token
)
"
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8"
\
'https://retail.googleapis.com/v2beta/projects/
PROJECT_NUMBER
/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/servingConfigs?pageSize=
PAGE_SIZE
&pageToken=
PAGE_TOKEN
'
Delete a serving config
You can delete serving configs using the Search for commerce console
