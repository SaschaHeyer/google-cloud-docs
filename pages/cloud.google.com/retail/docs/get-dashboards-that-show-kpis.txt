Get dashboards that show key performance indicators
This page explains the process for getting Looker dashboards that can
display key performance indicators for your retail business.
Before you begin
Before you can get Looker dashboards for your retail business, you
must:
Have your retail data uploaded using Vertex AI Search for commerce. For more
information, see:
Import catalog information
Record real-time user events
Import historical user events
Export your retail data from Vertex AI Search for commerce into
BigQuery. For more information, see
Export your data into
BigQuery
.
Alternatively, if your product and user event data is already in
BigQuery, in the Vertex AI Search for commerce format, you can use
that data to get Looker dashboards. In this case you don't need to
upload your retail data and export it to BigQuery. For more
information about the BigQuery format,
see
Product schema
and
About user events
.
Set up Looker
Get a Looker instance from your Looker Sales Engineer or
Professional Services consultant.
Set up a connection in Looker to BigQuery by
following the instructions in
Google
BigQuery
in the Looker
documentation. Your Looker Sales Engineer or Professional Services
consultant will assist you in this task if needed. Save the name of the
connection that you set up to use in
Install the Looker
Block
.
Convert your user event BigQuery view to a table
Looker Dashboards require your user event data to be in a BiqQuery
table, not a view.
To convert your user event BigQuery view to a table, do the
following:
Replace the variables in the following SQL example code as follows:
rdm_user_event_view
. The project, dataset, and table IDs of the user
event view that you exported to BigQuery. The format is
project_id.dataset_id.table_id
.
rdm_user_event_table
. The project, dataset, and table IDs in
BigQuery for the new BigQuery table. Use the
same project ID and dataset ID that you used for the user event view that
you exported to BigQuery. For the table ID, use
tbl_events
.
The format is
project_id.dataset_id.tbl_events
.
CREATE
OR
REPLACE
TABLE
`
RDM_USER_EVENT_TABLE
`
AS
SELECT
*
FROM
`
RDM_USER_EVENT_VIEW
`
Copy the SQL code sample from the previous step.
Open the BigQuery page in the Google Cloud console.
Go to the BigQuery page
If it's not already selected, select the project that contains your user
event table.
In the
Editor
pane, paste the SQL code sample.
Click
play_circle
Run
and wait for
the query to finish running.
Your new table is written to the location in BigQuery that you
set using the
rdm_user_event_table
variable. Save this location to use in
Install the Looker Block
.
Create a materialized view for sales
Use the following SQL example code to create a materialized view that your
Looker dashboards can query. For more information, see
Introduction to
materialized views
in the
BigQuery documentation.
To create a materialized view for sales, do the following:
Replace the variables in the following SQL example code as follows:
mv_sales
. The project, dataset, and table IDs in BigQuery
for the new materialized view for sales. Use the same project ID and dataset
ID that you used for the user event table that you exported to
BigQuery. For the table ID, use
mv_sales
. The format is
project_id.dataset_id.mv_sales
.
rdm_user_event_table
. The project, dataset, and table IDs of the user
event table that you exported to BigQuery. The format is
project_id.dataset_id.table_id
.
