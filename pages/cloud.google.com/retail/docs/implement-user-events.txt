Implement user events
To configure your user events:
Import
historical user events
.
Record
live user events
.
Tag user events
with entities
.
Flag user events with
attribution tokens
.
User information
The
visitorId
value represents the unique user identifier. It's required when you record a user event. (
UserInfo
) is included when you record a user event that has the
visitorId
value and, if available, the
userId
value.
You can use the optional
userId
value as a unique, persistent identifier for a user across devices whenever a user signs in to your site. When you record the
userId
for a user, Vertex AI Search for commerce can generate more personalized results for one user across multiple devices, such as a mobile device and web browser.
Note:
Use a secure form of a unique identifier to keep users anonymous to Vertex AI Search for commerce and
protect your users' privacy. You are responsible for redacting PII (personally identifiable
information), such as email or home addresses, from your data.
User event timestamp
When you record a user event, be sure to include an accurate timestamp of when
the event occurred. Accurate timestamps ensure that events are stored in the
correct order. Timestamps are recorded automatically for events collected using
Tag Manager and the JavaScript Pixel. When you
import events, you must provide the timestamp in the
eventTime
field in the format specified by
RFC 3339
.
Custom attributes for user events
You can include additional custom attributes and features for user events. This
can result in improved, more specific recommendations for your users when you
use recommendations. To add custom attributes, use
attributes
when you record a user event.
If you provide custom attributes for ingested user events, it's important to
also include them in the user events that you associate with prediction
requests. The formatting of custom attributes must be consistent between
imported events and events provided with prediction requests. This enables
use of those custom attributes when training models and
serving predictions, which helps improve recommendation quality.
You can provide custom text values by using the
text
field, or custom
numerical values by using the
number
field.
For example, the following shows the
attributes
section from a request
to record a user event:
"attributes"
:
{
"user_age"
:
{
"text"
:
[
"teen"
,
"young adult"
]},
"user_location"
:
{
"text"
:
[
"CA"
]}
}
Monitor import health
Recording user events successfully is important for getting high-quality
results. You should monitor the event recording error rates and take
action if needed. For more information, see
Setting up alerts for data upload issues
