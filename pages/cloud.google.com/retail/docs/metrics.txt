View analytics
This page describes metrics that can help you determine how Vertex AI Search for commerce is
affecting your business.
Prerequisites
The analytics dashboards use ingested
user events
as data sources for metrics. You must complete user events integration to be able to see user event analytics. Metrics are refreshed about every six hours, so it can take hours after you create your app to see metrics on the
Analytics
pages.
User events
The following user events are required to view some metrics:
Search events.
Required for any type of metrics.
Detail page view events.
Required for page view metrics.
Add-to-cart events.
Required for add-to-cart rate, conversion rate.
Purchase-complete events.
Required for total revenue, recommender-engaged revenue, average order value, purchase rate, revenue rate, average unit value, purchase order rate, conversion rate.
The following information is also used for analytics:
Product details
. To ensure accurate computation of search-related
metrics, include
UserInfo.productDetails
within
your user events. This information allows Vertex AI Search for commerce
to attribute searches with specific product interactions.
If the
UserInfo.ProductDetail.quantity
field is omitted within user
events, a default value of
1
will be assumed for calculations.
Revenue
. The
UserInfo.PurchaseTransaction.revenue
field is crucial
for generating accurate revenue metrics. Ensure this field is populated
within your user events to enable meaningful revenue-related analysis.
Attribution tokens
. Attribution tokens are unique IDs generated by
Vertex AI Search for commerce and returned with each search request. Make sure
to include that attribution token as
UserEvent.attributionToken
with any
user events resulting from a search. This is needed to identify if a search
is served by Vertex AI Search for commerce.
User agent
. Include
UserInfo.userAgent
with user events resulting
from a search so that you can filter on user event metrics by device type.

Configuration-specific metrics
Note:
Serving config metrics are only available for
recommendations.
You can see metrics for a specific serving config on the
Serving Configs page
.
For metric graphs, click a serving config name to go to its details page,
then select the
Analytics
tab.
This table provides definitions for configuration-specific metrics.
Metric
Description
Details
Click-through rate (CTR)
The number of product detail views from a serving config's
      recommendation panel, divided by the total number of
predict
queries for this serving config.
For example, if the serving config points to a Frequently Bought Together
      model, then the CTR would be the number of product detail pages viewed
      from the shopping cart recommendation panel divided by the number of
      predict queries on the shopping cart page.
Conversion rate (CVR)
The number of add-to-cart events from a serving config's
      recommendation panel divided by the total number of
predict
queries for this serving config.
Similar to CTR, except that instead of product detail views, conversion
      rate uses add-to-cart events.
Recommender-engaged revenue
The total revenue from the recommendations for this serving config.
Similar to recommender-engaged revenue for summary metrics, but for this
      serving config only.
To track clicks from a serving config, Vertex AI Search for commerce aligns the
results in
predict
and
search
responses with ingested user events. If a
clicked item appears in the responses for the same visitor ID within a
one hour time window, the click or purchase is treated as a result of the
Vertex AI Search for commerce.
This process is fully automatic; you don't need to set anything up. However,
when you configure your prediction and search requests for the first time, you
should confirm that:
Visitor IDs in the request are the same as the visitor IDs you used in event
ingestions.
The timestamp in the response roughly match the timestamp for that event.
When metrics are compared to the ideal expected result, or ground truth, the
values might be lower, but the trends align.
A more direct alternative to this method is to use
attribution tokens
. This requires significant instrumentation and
is only recommended as an advanced tracking use case.
