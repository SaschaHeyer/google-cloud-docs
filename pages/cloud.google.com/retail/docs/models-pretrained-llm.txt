Utilizing pretrained LLM
This page describes how to use a textual large-language model (LLM) in the custom recommendation models. We train these models for you. You can enable the pretrained features in the
custom recommendation models
.
Recommendations uses the product
description
field to feed to LLMs and put them into your recommendations models.
Note:
Creating and configuring models is only available for
recommendations.
New LLM textual features
While it's possible to get text embeddings by
manually configuring a Vertex AI generative model
, you might want to integrate the new LLM capabilities into your recommendations models to improve performance.
The text embeddings are more descriptive, longer, and are not repetitive, as well as have multilingual interpretation capabilities. This feature is based on an allowlist. Contact support for enabling this feature.
There's no charge for using the text embeddings and they are included in Vertex AI Search
pricing
.
The LLM-pretrained embeddings improve semantic understanding of long form text searches such as descriptions.
See the following resources for more information on how to use embeddings and generative AI alone in your own custom ML training:
Vertex AI generative AI documentation
Machine Learning Crash Course: Embeddings
Model compatibility
The LLM feature is compatible with all ml model types and objectives, including:
OYML
FBT
and more.
For more information on the different types of recommendation models Vertex AI Search for commerce supports, see
