You set the language when you upload your catalog for your Vertex AI Search for commerce project. The catalog should be in one language only and search queries should be sent in the same language. Having multiple languages in the catalog degrades LLM performance.
Note:
If you already have a mixed language catalog for search, you can improve results by adding synonyms for search query terms. For example, add both Spanish and English synonyms. For information about synonyms, see
OnewaySynonymsAction
and
TwowaySynonymsAction
.
