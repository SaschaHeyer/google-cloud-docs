Authenticate to Vertex AI Search for commerce
This document describes how to authenticate to Vertex AI Search for commerce programmatically. How
      you authenticate to Vertex AI Search for commerce depends on the interface you use to access the API
      and the environment where your code is running.
For more information about Google Cloud authentication, see the
Authentication methods
.
API access
Vertex AI Search for commerce supports programmatic access. You can access the API in
      the following ways:
Client libraries
REST
Client libraries
The
Vertex AI Search for commerce client libraries
provide
        high-level language support for authenticating to Vertex AI Search for commerce
        programmatically.
        

To authenticate calls to Google Cloud APIs, client libraries support
Application Default Credentials (ADC)
;
the libraries look for credentials in a set of defined locations and use those credentials
to authenticate requests to the API. With ADC, you can make
credentials available to your application in a variety of environments, such as local
development or production, without needing to modify your application code.
REST
You can authenticate to
the Vertex AI Search for commerce API
by using your gcloud CLI credentials or by using
Application Default Credentials
.
        For more information about authentication for REST requests, see
Authenticate for using REST
.
        For information about the types of credentials, see
gcloud CLI credentials and ADC credentials
.
API keys
API keys provide a way to associate an API call with a project, which is used for billing
        and quota purposes, without determining the identity of the caller. API keys can be used
        only with API methods that support API keys.
Vertex AI Search for commerce supports API keys for the following API methods:
userEvents.collect
For more information about using API keys with Vertex AI Search for commerce, see
Create an API key
.
        
        For general information about using API keys, see
Authenticate using API keys
.
User credentials and ADC for Vertex AI Search for commerce
One way to provide credentials to ADC is to use the gcloud CLI to insert your
        user credentials into a credential file. This file is placed on your local file system where
        ADC can find it; ADC then uses the provided user credentials to authenticate requests. This
        method is often used for local development.
If you use this method, you might encounter an authentication error when you try to
        authenticate to Vertex AI Search for commerce. For more information about this error and how
        to address it, see
User credentials not working
.
Set up authentication for Vertex AI Search for commerce
How you set up authentication depends on the environment where your code is running.
The following options for setting up authentication are the most commonly used. For more
        options and information about authentication, see
Authentication methods
.
Before you complete these instructions, you must complete the basic setup for
          Vertex AI Search for commerce, as described in
Before you begin
.
For a local development environment
You can set up credentials for a local development environment in the following ways:
User credentials for client libraries or third-party tools
User credentials for REST requests from the command line
Service account impersonation
Client libraries or third-party tools
Set up
Application Default Credentials (ADC)
in your local environment:
Install
the Google Cloud CLI.
        
          After installation,
initialize
the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud
init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity
.
If you're using a local shell, then create local authentication credentials for your user
        account:
gcloud
auth
application-default
login
You don't need to do this if you're using Cloud Shell.
Note:
If the gcloud CLI prints a warning that your account
          doesn't have the
serviceusage.services.use
permission, then some
          gcloud CLI commands and client libraries might not work. Ask an
          administrator to grant you the Service Usage Consumer IAM role
          (
roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer
), then run the following command:
gcloud
auth
application-default
set-quota-project
PROJECT_ID
If an authentication error is returned, and you are using an external identity provider
        (IdP), confirm that you have
signed in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity
.
A sign-in screen appears. After you sign in, your credentials are stored in the
local credential file used by ADC
.
For more information about working with ADC in a local environment, see
Set up ADC for a local development environment
.
REST requests from the command line
When you make a REST request from the command line,
          you can use your gcloud CLI credentials by including
gcloud auth print-access-token
as part of the command that sends the request.
The following example lists service accounts for the specified project. You can use the
          same pattern for any REST request.
Before using any of the request data,
  make the following replacements:
PROJECT_ID
: Your Google Cloud project ID.
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Execute the following command:
curl -X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project:
PROJECT_ID
" \
"https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/
PROJECT_ID
/serviceAccounts"
PowerShell (Windows)
Execute the following command:
$cred = gcloud auth print-access-token
$headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $cred"; "x-goog-user-project" = "
PROJECT_ID
" }
Invoke-WebRequest `
-Method GET `
-Headers $headers `
-Uri "https://iam.googleapis.com/v1/projects/
PROJECT_ID
/serviceAccounts" | Select-Object -Expand Content
For more information about authenticating using REST and gRPC, see
Authenticate for using REST
.
          For information about the difference between your local ADC credentials and your
          gcloud CLI credentials, see
gcloud CLI authentication configuration and ADC configuration
.
Service account impersonation
In most cases, you can use your user credentials to authenticate from a local development
        environment. If that is not feasible, or if you need to test the permissions assigned to
        a service account, you can use service account impersonation. You must have the
iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken
permission, which is included in the
Service Account Token Creator
(
roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator
) IAM role.
You can set up the gcloud CLI to use service account impersonation by using the
gcloud config set
command
:
gcloud
config
set
auth/impersonate_service_account
SERVICE_ACCT_EMAIL
For select languages, you can use service account impersonation to create a local ADC file
        for use by client libraries. This approach is supported only for the Go, Java, Node.js, and
        Python client libraries—it is not supported for the other languages.
        To set up a local ADC file with service account impersonation, use the
--impersonate-service-account
flag
with the
gcloud auth application-default login
command
:
gcloud
auth
application-default
login
--impersonate-service-account
=
SERVICE_ACCT_EMAIL
For more information about service account impersonation, see
Use service account impersonation
.
On Google Cloud
To authenticate a workload running on Google Cloud, you use the credentials of the
          service account attached to the compute resource where your code is running, such as a
Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance
.
          This approach is the preferred authentication method for code running on a
          Google Cloud compute resource.
For most services, you must attach the service account when you create the
          resource that will run your code; you cannot add or replace the service account
          later. Compute Engine is an exception—it lets you attach a service
          account to a VM instance at any time.
Use the gcloud CLI to create a service account and attach it to your
          resource:
Install
the Google Cloud CLI.
        
          After installation,
initialize
the Google Cloud CLI by running the following command:
gcloud
init
If you're using an external identity provider (IdP), you must first
sign in to the gcloud CLI with your federated identity
.
Set up authentication:
Ensure that you have the Create Service Accounts IAM role
    (
roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator
).
Learn how to grant roles
.
Create the service account:
gcloud
iam
service-accounts
create
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
Replace
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
with a name for the service account.
To provide access to your project and your resources, grant a role to the service account:
gcloud
projects
add-iam-policy-binding
PROJECT_ID
--member
=
"serviceAccount:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
@
PROJECT_ID
.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
--role
=
ROLE
Replace the following:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
: the name of the service account
PROJECT_ID
: the project ID where you created the service account
ROLE
: the role to grant
Note
: The
--role
flag affects which resources the service account can access in your
    project. You can revoke these roles or grant additional roles later.
    
      
  In production environments, do not grant the Owner, Editor, or Viewer roles. Instead, grant a
predefined role
or
custom role
that meets your needs.
To grant another role to the service account, run the command as you did in the previous step.
Grant the required role to the principal that
      will attach the service account to other resources.
gcloud
iam
service-accounts
add-iam-policy-binding
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
@
PROJECT_ID
.iam.gserviceaccount.com
--member
=
"user:
USER_EMAIL
"
--role
=
roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
Replace the following:
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
: the name of the service account
PROJECT_ID
: the project ID where you created the service account
USER_EMAIL
: the email address for a Google Account
Create the resource that will run your code, and attach the service account to that
              resource. For example, if you use Compute Engine:
Create a Compute Engine instance. Configure the instance as follows:
Replace
INSTANCE_NAME
with your preferred
          instance name.
Set the
--zone
flag to the
zone
in which you want to create
          your instance.
Set the
--service-account
flag to the email address for the service account
          that you created.
gcloud
compute
instances
create
INSTANCE_NAME
--zone=
ZONE
--service-account=
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
For more information about authenticating to Google APIs, see
Authentication methods
.
On-premises or on a different cloud provider
The preferred method to set up authentication from outside of Google Cloud is to use
          workload identity federation. For more information, see
Set up ADC for on-premises or another cloud provider
in the authentication documentation.
