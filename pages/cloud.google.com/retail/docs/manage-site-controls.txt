Manage site-wide attribute controls
This page describes how to manage site-wide attribute controls.
Site-wide controls apply to all search results or all recommendation
results, depending on what type of site-wide attribute control you apply.
About site-wide attribute controls
Side-wide attribute controls enable you to manage settings globally across all
serving configurations.
Site-wide attribute controls are available in the Search for commerce
console for your catalog's product attributes.
Search uses the following attribute settings:
Indexable
: Search can filter and facet using this attribute.
Dynamic faceting
: Search can automatically use this
    attribute as a dynamic facet based on past user behavior such as facet clicks
    and views. To enable dynamic faceting for an attribute,
Indexable
must be set to true for that attribute.
Searchable
: This attribute is searchable by search
    queries, which increases recall for that attribute. This control is applicable
    only for text attributes.
Retrievable
: If set to true, search returns this
    attribute in responses to search queries. If all attributes have
    Retrievable set to false, the search results contain only the product name
    or (for variants) the product name and color information. The REST field RetrievableFields is deprecated for products. Use the retrievable site-wide control instead.
Recommendations uses the following attribute settings:
Filterable
(Public Preview): This attribute can be used in recommendations
    filter expressions. This control is applicable only for text attributes.
You can enable or disable side-wide attribute controls for individual
attributes.
Dynamic faceting is available as a site-wide attribute control. By default,
dynamic faceting is enabled for all custom attributes.
In
catalog-level configuration mode
, site-wide attribute controls
are available for indexable and searchable.
For details about attribute configurations and what their default and allowed
settings are, see the topic
About product attributes
.
Modify site-wide attribute controls
Change a site-wide attribute control on the
Controls page
in the
Search for commerce console.
Note:
Setting site-wide attribute controls globally is available in the default
catalog-level configuration mode
. Previously, product-level
configuration was the default mode. If you are still on product-level
configuration mode and need to switch modes, contact Vertex AI Search for commerce support.
Go to the
Controls
page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Controls page
Go to the
Site-wide controls
tab.
This tab displays a table of all product attributes you can set site-wide
attribute controls for.
Click
edit
Modify Controls
.
Enable or disable a control.
True
: Enable a control for that attribute. This overrides any
product-level attributes configuration.
False
: Disable a control for that attribute. This overrides any
product-level attribute configuration.
Note that you can only set dynamic faceting to true for attributes that
are also set to indexable.
Click
Save Controls
.
Changes to attribute configuration settings for indexable and searchable take
effect within 12 hours, or immediately on your next catalog ingestion.
Dynamic faceting configuration changes take up to two days. You can test if
your changes have been applied on the
Evaluate
page
, which will
reflect your changes immediately.
