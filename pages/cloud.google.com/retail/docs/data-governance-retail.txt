Data governance for commerce
Google was one of the first in the industry to publish an
AI/ML Privacy Commitment
,
which outlines our belief that customers should have the highest level of
security and control over their data that is stored in the cloud. That
commitment extends to Google Cloud generative AI products. Google helps verify
that its teams are following these commitments through robust data governance
practices, which includes reviews of the data that Google Cloud uses in
the development of its products. More details about how Google processes data
can also be found in
Google's Customer Data Processing Addendum (CDPA)
.
Responsible AI
As a developer using Vertex AI Search for commerce, you can access Google's foundation
models, search expertise, and conversational AI technologies to create
enterprise-grade generative AI applications through Vertex AI Search.
However, as an early-stage technology, its changing capabilities and uses create
potential for misapplication and unintended consequences. For example,
Vertex AI Search for commerce can generate unexpected output, including text that's
offensive or incorrect.
Given these risks and complexities, Vertex AI Search for commerce is designed with
Google's
AI Principles
in mind, but you must
understand and test the models to deploy them safely and responsibly. To aid
developers, Vertex AI Search for commerce has built-in safety filters to help
customers block potentially harmful outputs within their use case. For more
information, see Google's
Privacy Resource Center
.
When Vertex AI Search for commerce is integrated into a customer's unique context, you 
might need to consider additional responsible AI considerations and model
limitations. We encourage you to follow
recommended best practices
.
Use of generative AI
Vertex AI Search for commerce uses generative AI services for building search, personalized,
and conversational experiences. As part of the Google Cloud AI/ML Privacy Commitment, customer data used
in Vertex AI Search for commerce is not used to train foundation models. Foundation models are frozen and only process input to provide output for the
services provided by Vertex AI Search for commerce.
Customer-specific models
When applicable, customer-specific models are built automatically and used only
in the context of the Vertex AI Search for commerce service customer-specific project.
Customer data used to create these retailer-specific models isn't used to
train foundation models. Models specific to Vertex AI Search for commerce, like all
customer data, continue to be protected by
Google's security controls and best practices
