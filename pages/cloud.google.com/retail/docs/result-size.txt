Query expansion
Query expansion is the incremental loosening of query constraints to include more results when none or too few are initially found. This leads to an adjustment of the result size per query.
When there are no relevant documents at all for a query, Query expansion will return less relevant documents to ensure that query does not return zero search results.
Query expansion tutorial
This tutorial shows you how to enable the query expansion feature. When a shopper uses an ambiguous or a multi-word search phrase, they can get an empty response. After turning on query expansion, the request is analyzed and the expanded list of products based on the parsed search query gets returned.

Query expansion
Query expansion increases the recall for query terms with few results,
especially long tail queries.
This search feature is driven by a
specification
determining query-expansion conditions. It includes a
pinUnexpandedResults
option that's off by default. When set to
true
, it displays unexpanded products at the top of search results. The top is followed by the expanded results.

For example, if you search for
Google Pixel 5
without query expansion, the
result will be restricted to
google_pixel_5
IDs. However, with query
expansion, you might also get
google_pixel_4a_with_5g
,
google_pixel_4a
, and
google_pixel_5_case
IDs in the
example product description dataset
as well.
