Implement Vertex AI Search for commerce
You can implement Vertex AI Search for commerce for your ecommerce application.
When you use recommendations or search, you
ingest user event and catalog data and to
serve predictions or search results on your site.
The same data is used for both
recommendations and search, so if you use both,
you don't need to ingest the same data twice.
Tip:
See the
User event requirements and best practices
for user event
data that recommendations and search use.
If you use recommendations models,
User event data requirements
lists additional requirements
depending on your model type and optimization objective. These requirements help
Vertex AI Search for commerce generate quality results.
The average integration time is in the order of
weeks. Note that for search, the actual duration depends
heavily on the quality and quantity of data to ingest.
Warning:
Never cache personalized results from an end user, and never return personalized
results to a different end user.
Commerce integration overview
Migrate in four phases
Migrating your search engine is a structured, four-phased approach that helps to ensure that every aspect of the migration is addressed to minimize risks and maximize your investment.
Manage the expectations of your merchandising teams and sellers by doing the following:
Keep merchant teams informed
: Proactively communicate the changes that are coming and why the company is moving to an AI-first approach.
Educate teams on the new paradigm
: Explain that the system is based on user behavior and intent detection, which leads to a more dynamic, personalized, and ultimately more profitable ranking. The search results will look different.
Set clear guidelines for business rules
: Emphasize that business rules can be applied only for specific, data-backed business reasons, such as contractual obligations or a clear revenue-driving strategy. The goal is to let the AI do its job.
A/B test new rules
: If a new rule is proposed post-migration, the most data driven way to validate its effectiveness is to run another A/B test, one group with the rule, one group without the rule. Let the data decide whether the rule is promoted to production.
By diligently following this four-phased approach, a typical migration to A/B testing can be achieved in about two to three months, depending on the current search system complexity and speed of execution. This methodology has been designed and proven across numerous customer adoptions.
Note:
Attempting to sprint through or skip steps can cause rework and delays.
