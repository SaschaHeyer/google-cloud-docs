Manage models
This page describes how to tune, pause, resume, delete, and list
recommendation models. For help with creating a new recommendation model, see
Create recommendation models
.
Note:
Model management is only available for recommendations.
General recommendations for model quality
Events should generally be uploaded at least daily to maintain good data quality.
Data age limits
: User events older than 2015 are not accepted. For auto-learning suggestions, the system uses user events from the past 180 days. Similarly, metrics for user events older than 180 days or generated more than 180 days ago are not exportable.
Unique visitor IDs
: The total number of unique visitor IDs for each event type should be at least 100 to ensure enough data for quality results.
Most models perform best with at least three months of product page views, home page views, and
add-to-cart
events.
For the Frequently Bought Together model, one to two years of purchase history is recommended. This model specifically requires
one
of the following:
On average, 10 occurrences per catalog item (with a one-year window of purchase-complete events).
Both
90 days of purchase-complete events in the last year
and
1,000 purchase-complete events in that same year.
One to two weeks of detail-page views can be sufficient to begin training
Others You May Like
and
Recommended for You
models.
Tune a model
Vertex AI Search for commerce uses the input data you provide to your model to
adjust hyperparameters for training.
Tuning takes 2-4 days, during which the model continues to work as usual.
 For tuning cost details, see
Pricing
.
Set a model's tuning frequency
We recommend you periodically tune your model. This keeps model training optimal
as data changes and customer behavior differs throughout the year. In addition,
some internal major model upgrades can only be applied after the model has
been tuned.
When creating the model, you can set it to automatically tune every three
months, or choose to only tune it manually. Regardless of the setting you
choose, the model automatically tunes one time after creation.
You can change the tuning status setting at any time. Changing this setting
doesn't affect running tuning processes.
To edit a model's tuning status setting:
Console
Go to the
Models
page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Models page
You can see the tuning status of every model under
Tuning status
.
Click a model name to view its details page.
Click
Edit
edit
next to
Tuning
status
.
From the drop-down list, select a setting:
Every three months
. Automatically tunes when the last tune was 90
days ago.
Manual tune only
. Tunes only when you
manually tune
.
Click
Done
done
to save your setting.

Manually tune a model
Manual tune triggers a one-time tune of your model. You might manually tune your
model when there is a significant change in your catalog (such as size increase
or change in catalog hierarchy) or events (such as backfilling historical events
or a change in data distribution after promoting certain groups of items).
To manually tune a model:
Console
Go to the
Models
page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Models page
Click a model name to view its details page.
Click
Manual Tune
in the button bar.
Tuning takes 2-4 days, during which the model continues to work as usual.

Make a
Models.tune
request using the API. See the
Models.tune
API reference.

Pause and resume training for a model
If your model is active (not paused), the model is retrained at least once a
week, but no more often than once a day. For consistent retraining, make sure
that you upload user event data no more than 24 hours after the event occurs.
You can pause your model to stop retraining. You might want to do this if you
have imported bad data or to stay under the limit of 10 active models per
project. If you have fewer than 10 active models,
you can restart a paused model at any time.
For training cost details, see
Pricing
.
You can start up to five model operations per minute. Limited model operations
include creation, deletion, pause, and resume.
To pause or restart a model:
Console
Go to the
Models
page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Models page
You can see the training status of every model under
Training status
.
To pause an active model (
Training status
of
TRAINING
), click
Pause
pause
.
To start a paused model (

of

To pause an active model, make a
Models.pause
request using the
API. See the
Models.pause
API reference.
