Set up Cloud Monitoring alerts
This page describes how you can create alerts for Vertex AI Search for commerce,
including examples of creating alerts for user event recording, predictions,
and searches.
For information about data quality alerts, see
Data quality alerts
.
For information about troubleshooting errors and viewing error logs, see
Troubleshooting data upload issues
.
Introduction
Keeping your catalog up to date and recording user events successfully is
important for getting high-quality results. Even if your initial imports
and event recording are successful, monitoring error rates is still needed in
case of unexpected environmental issues, such as network connectivity failures.
You should set up Cloud Monitoring alerts so you can take action promptly in
case any issues arise with user event recording, predictions, and search
results. You can also monitor recent data integration error rates in the
Google Cloud console at any time.
Set up Cloud Monitoring alerts
Cloud Monitoring can be set up to alert on a large number of triggers.
When you set up alerts, Vertex AI Search for commerce suggests
several to set up. If you're unsure which alerts to set up, start with setting
up alerts for
prediction errors
,
search errors
, and
reductions in user event recording
.
Set up an alert for prediction errors
Generally, calling the
predict
method should rarely return an error. This
alert is triggered if the number of errors returned by the predict method causes
the error ratio to stay above the given threshold for more than 5 minutes. You
can adjust the threshold to suit your environment.
To set up alerts from the Search for commerce console:
Go to the
Monitoring
page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Monitoring page
Click
add
Recommended Alerts
.
The Recommended Alert Policies panel appears on the right. It displays a list
of recommended alerts to set up for your project.
Enable
High predict error ratio
.
Optionally, adjust the threshold to suit your environment.
The default predict error ratio is 0.03.
Choose a notification channel through which you'll be notified if the alert
is triggered, such as an email address or mobile device.
To set up a new notification channel, select
Notification Channels >
refresh
Manage Notification Channels
.
See
the Cloud Monitoring documentation
for more about creating and editing channels.
Click the
Submit
button to create your alert.
You can also create a custom alert by using Cloud Monitoring. For more
information, see
the Cloud Monitoring documentation
.
Set up an alert for search errors
This alert is triggered if the number of errors returned by the
search
method
causes the error ratio to stay above the given threshold for more than 5
minutes. You can adjust the threshold to suit your environment.
To set up alerts from the Search for commerce console:
Go to the
Monitoring
page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Monitoring page
Click

Recommended Alerts
.
The Recommended Alert Policies panel appears on the right. It displays a list
of recommended alerts to set up for your project.

Choose a notification channel through which you'll be notified if the alert
is triggered, such as an email address or mobile device.
To set up a new notification channel, select
Notification Channels >
refresh
Manage Notification Channels
.
See
the Cloud Monitoring documentation
for more about creating and editing channels.
Click the
Submit
button to create your alert.
You can also create a custom alert by using Cloud Monitoring. For more
information, see
the Cloud Monitoring documentation
.
Set up an alert for user event recording reduction
If you see a drop in user event recording that lasts for a prolonged period of
time, there could be issues with your user event recording code. This alert
is triggered if you don't record any user events for 10 minutes.
To set up a user event recording reduction alert from the Search for commerce console:
Go to the
Monitoring
page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Monitoring page
Click
add
Recommended Alerts
.
The Recommended Alert Policies panel appears on the right. It displays a list
of recommended alerts to set up for your project.
Enable
User events record reduction
.
Choose a notification channel through which you'll be notified if the alert
is triggered, such as an email address or mobile device.
To set up a new notification channel, select
Notification Channels >
refresh
Manage Notification Channels
.
See
the Cloud Monitoring documentation
for more about creating and editing channels.
Click the
Submit
button to create your alert.
If you are using a method other than
WriteUserEvent
, such as
ImportUserEvents
, you can also create a custom alert by using Cloud Monitoring. For more
information, see the
Cloud Monitoring documentation
.
Set up an alert for unjoined user events
This alert is triggered if the ratio of user events that aren't associated with
valid products stays above the given threshold for more than one or twelve
hours. You can choose the time window and adjust the threshold.
To set up a user event recording reduction alert from the Search for commerce console:
Go to the
Monitoring
page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Monitoring page
Click
add
Recommended Alerts
.
The Recommended Alert Policies panel appears on the right. It displays a list
of recommended alerts to set up for your project.
Enable
Ratio of unjoined user events ratio is above the threshold for last hour
or
Ratio of unjoined user events increases above threshold for last 12 hours
.
Optionally, adjust the threshold to suit your environment.
The default unjoined events ratio is 0.1. This means that if more than 10% of total events ingested are not joined with a valid product within the specified time window, an alert is triggered.
Choose a notification channel through which you'll be notified if the alert
is triggered, such as an email address or mobile device.
To set up a new notification channel, select
Notification Channels >
refresh
Manage Notification Channels
.
See
the Cloud Monitoring documentation
for more about creating and editing channels.
Click the
Submit
button to create your alert.
