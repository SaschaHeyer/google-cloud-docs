About recommendation models
This page describes the recommendation models
with their default serving configs and optimization objectives,
available customizations, and supported event types.
Note:
Creating and configuring models is only available for
recommendations.
Introduction
When you sign up to use Vertex AI Search for commerce, you work with
Vertex AI Search for commerce Support to determine the best recommendation models and
customizations to use for your site. The models and customizations you use
depend on your business needs, and where you plan to display the resulting
recommendations.
When you request recommendations, you provide
the serving config value to the
placement
resource. (See
About serving
configurations
for details about using the
placement
resource for
serving configs, and about support for placements, which were previously
used to place models.) The serving config
determines which model is used to return your recommendations. You can also
filter your results
.
Recommendation model types
These are the recommendation model types:
Others You May Like
Frequently Bought Together
(shopping cart expansion)
Recommended for You
Buy it Again
On-sale
Recently Viewed
Page-Level Optimization
Others You May Like
The Others You May Like recommendation predicts the next product that a user is most
likely to engage or convert with. The prediction is based on the shopping and
viewing history of the user and the candidate product's relevance to a current
specified product.
Default optimization objective:
click-through rate
Default serving config:
N/A
Available customizations:
Change optimization objective to
conversion rate
or
revenue per session
.
Add
price reranking
.
Add
Result diversification
(supported but not recommended).
Supported pages for model deployment:
Detail page. See
detail-page-view
event.
Add-to-cart page. See
add-to-cart
event.
Frequently Bought Together (shopping cart expansion)
The Frequently Bought Together recommendation predicts items frequently bought together for a
specific product within the same shopping session. If a list of products is
being viewed, then it predicts items frequently bought with that product list.
This recommendation is useful when the user has indicated an intent to purchase
a particular product (or list of products) already, and you are looking to
recommend complements (as opposed to substitutes). This recommendation is
commonly displayed on the
add-to-cart
page, or on the shopping cart or
registry pages (for shopping cart expansion).
Default optimization objective:
revenue per session
Default serving config:
N/A
Available customizations:
Add
Result diversification
(supported but not recommended)
Choose the
context product type
Note:
Boost controls and diversity (rule-based or data-driven) are not compatible with each other. Only specify one of these settings at a time.
Supported pages for model deployment:
Detail page. See
detail-page-view
event.
Add-to-cart page. See
add-to-cart
event.
Shopping cart page. See
shopping-cart-page-view
event
Purchase-complete page. See
purchase-complete
event.
Recommended for You
The Recommended for You recommendation predicts the next product that a user
is most likely to engage with or purchase, based on the shopping or viewing
history of that user and contextual information of requests, such as timestamps.
This recommendation is typically used on the home page.
Recommended for You can also be useful on category pages. 
A category page is similar to a home page, except that you display only items from that category.
You can achieve this using a standard Recommended for You model with filter tags.
For example, you can add customized filter tags (corresponding to each category page) to the items
in your catalog. When you send the prediction request, set the user event object as
category-page-view
and specify a specific category page's tag in the
filter
field. Only recommendation results matching the requested filter tag are
returned. Diversity should be disabled in this use case, because diversity can conflict with
category-based filter tags.

Buy it Again
The Buy it Again model encourages purchasing items again based on previous recurring
purchases. This personalized model predicts products that have been previously
bought at least once and that are typically bought on a regular cadence. The
interval at which a product is suggested depends on the product and site
visitor. Recommendations from this model can be used on any page type.
The Buy it Again model uses purchase-complete user events.
The Buy it Again model cannot be tuned.
We recommend creating only one Buy it Again model per project. Because Buy it Again models
are not customizable, creating multiple Buy it Again models based on the same user
events does not produce different recommendations and can incur unnecessary
costs.
Default optimization objective:
N/A
Default serving config:
N/A
Available customizations:

On-sale
The On-sale model type is a personalized promotions-based model that can
recommend on-sale products. You can use this model type to encourage users to
purchase discounted items.
Typically used on the home page, add-to-cart page, shopping cart page, category
page, and detail page.
Default optimization objective:
Click-through rate
Default serving config:
N/A
Available customizations:
Change optimization objective to
conversion rate
Supported pages for model deployment:
Detail page. See

shopping-cart-page-view
event.
Purchase-complete page. See

Recently Viewed
The Recently Viewed recommendation is not actually a recommendation. It provides the
IDs of products the user or visitor has recently interacted with, with the most
recent products first.
Default optimization objective:

Default serving config:
recently_viewed_default
Available customizations:

Page-Level Optimization
Page-Level Optimization extends recommendations from optimizing for a single
recommendation panel at a time to optimizing for an entire page with multiple
panels. The Page-Level Optimization model automatically selects the contents for each panel and
determines the panel order on your page.
For example, home pages are typically structured with products organized into
rows of related groups, such as categories, trending items, or recently viewed
products. Using the Page-Level Optimization model on a home page can provide an end user with
a personalized recommendation experience while automating the decision process
for coordinating model combinations and layouts for that page.
To create a Page-Level Optimization model, you must first have existing recommendation serving
configurations that have trained models. When creating a Page-Level Optimization model, you
specify what type of page you'll use the model on, what restrictions you'll
apply to limit serving similar serving configs, what business objective to
optimize for (CTR or CVR), how many recommendation panels to display, and which
serving configs to consider for each panel.
Just as with other models, to use the Page-Level Optimization model you make a prediction call
using a serving config that contains the "Page-Level Optimization" model. Instead of
recommendations, the prediction response contains a sorted list of serving
config IDs representing the serving config to use for each panel. Then, make a
new prediction call for each panel with the corresponding serving config ID that
was returned from the Page-Level Optimization model. The prediction response for each panel
contains the list of recommended items to display in that panel.

When you enable this feature
Your description information should be explanatory for each product and contain unique information or words separate from the title.
this feature works best when there are at least 10 description words on average.
The percentage of events containing unknown item_ids should be under 10 percent. (The unjoined ratio can be
checked
. Read more about the
definition of unjoined ratio
).
Optimization for business objectives
Machine learning models are created to optimize for a particular business
objective, which determines how the model is built. Each model has a default
optimization objective, but you can request a different optimization objective
to support your business goals by contacting your support representative.
After you have trained a model, you cannot change the optimization objective.
You must train a new model to use a different optimization objective.
Vertex AI Search for commerce supports the following optimization objectives.
Click-through rate (CTR)
Optimizing for CTR emphasizes engagement; you should optimize for CTR when you
want to maximize the likelihood that the user interacts with the recommendation.
CTR is the default optimization objective for the
Others You May Like
and
Recommended for You
recommendation model types.
Revenue per session
The revenue per session optimization objective is available for
"Others You May Like"
,
"Recommended for You"
, and
"Frequently Bought Together"
recommendation
model types. Although objective works differently for each model, the goal is
the same, to increase revenue.
For Others You May Like and Recommended for You.
The objective combines information from clicks,
conversions, and item prices to help the model recommend items that have higher
prices and a higher probability of being purchased.
For Frequently Bought Together.
This objective optimizes for recommending items with a higher
probability of being added to carts, benefiting revenue with by expanding cart
sizes.
Conversion rate (CVR)
Optimizing for conversion rate maximizes the likelihood that the user adds the
recommended item to their cart; if you want to increase the number of items
added to a cart per session, optimize for conversion rate.
Advanced model configuration options
Depending on the model type, there are some other model configuration options
you can use to change the behavior of your model.
Tuning preference
Tuning keeps model training optimal as input data changes over time. Set your
model to automatically tune every three months, or choose to only tune it
manually. The model automatically tunes one time after creation.

Available serving configs and models
Before you can request predictions from your model, you must create at least one
serving config for it. For more information, see
Create serving configs
.
You can see your models listed on the
Models page
. Click a model name to
go to its details page, where you can see serving configs associated with
that model.
Context products
When generating a recommendation, models take into account the products that a
user has previously interacted with in the context of the recommendation panel.
These contextual products are passed into the body of a
predict
request as part of a user event. For example, if there is a
recommendation panel on a shopping cart page, any
shopping-cart-page-view
user event that triggers a
predict
request should include the products that
are in the shopping cart at that time. These products are used as the
context products for that recommendation.
When creating a Frequently Bought Together model, you specify whether that model will generate
recommendations in the context of one or multiple items. Which option you choose
depends on what type of page you plan to use the model.
Multiple context products (default)
: The Frequently Bought Together model can use one or
multiple products as context for its recommendations. This use case is
typically for shopping cart pages that have a variety of contextual products
that can inform the recommendation to be served on that page.
Single context product
: The Frequently Bought Together model can use only one context
product. This use case is typically for pages that have a single product that
would be used as context for recommendations, such as add-to-cart pages and
product detail pages.
Passing more than one product in a
predict
request from a single context
product Frequently Bought Together model does not fail, although it is not recommended because
it might not result in optimal recommendations.
