Measure performance
The Search for commerce console provides metrics to help you
determine how incorporating Vertex AI Search for commerce is affecting your
business.
View metrics
You can view summary metrics for your project on the
Analytics
page. This page displays
site-wide metrics about revenue and orders. See
Summary
metrics
for metrics definitions.
For metrics specific to your serving configs, go to the
Serving Configs
page.
Click a serving config name and select the
Analytics
tab to see its
metrics. See
Configuration-specific metrics
for metrics
definitions.
Metrics definitions
This table provides definitions of the summary metrics that
Vertex AI Search for commerce displays on the
Analytics
page.
Metric
Description
Details
Total revenue
The total revenue from all recorded purchase events.
This value includes shipping and tax.
Results-engaged revenue
The revenue for purchase events that include at least one product that was
      selected from a recommendation or search result.
This value includes shipping and tax and any discount applied.
Average order value (AOV)
The average value of orders from all purchase events.
Total revenue divided by the number of orders.
Results-engaged AOV
The average value of orders that include at least one item selected
      from a recommendation or search result.
Results-engaged revenue divided by the number of orders with at least
      one item that was selected from a recommendation or search result.
Configuration-specific metrics
You can see metrics for a specific serving config on the
Serving Configs
page.
For metric graphs, click the configuration name and select the
Analytics
tab.
This table provides definitions for configuration-specific metrics.
Metric
Description
Details
Click-through rate (CTR)
The number of product detail views from a serving config divided by
      the total number of
predict
or
search
queries for this configuration.
For example, if a recommendations serving config
      points to a "Frequently Bought Together" model, then the CTR would be the number of product
      detail pages viewed from the shopping cart recommendation panel divided by
      the number of
predict
queries on the shopping cart page.
Add-to-cart events
The number of add-to-cart events from a serving config
      divided by the total number of predict or search queries for that
      configuration.
Purchase events
The total purchase events from the recommendations or search results from
      this serving config.
To track clicks from a serving config, Vertex AI Search for commerce
aligns the recommendations in
predict
responses and search results in
search
responses with ingested user events. If a clicked item appears in the
predict
or
search
responses for the same visitor ID within a one hour time window, the
click and purchase is treated as a result of the recommendation or search result.
When you configure your recommendations or search requests for the first time, you
should confirm that:
Visitor IDs in the request are the same as the visitor IDs you used in event
ingestions.
The timestamp in the response roughly matches the timestamp for that event.
When Vertex AI Search for commerce metrics are compared to the ideal expected result,
or ground truth, the values might be lower, but the trends align.
Unlike for recommendations, the process of attributing click to search requests is not fully automatic. So for metrics to work for Vertex AI Search for commerce, an
attribution token
is required. However, attribution tokens are not needed for recommendations user events.
