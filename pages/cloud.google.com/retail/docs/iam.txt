Identity and Access Management (IAM)
This page describes how you can control Vertex AI Search for commerce access and
permissions using Identity and Access Management (IAM).
Overview
Google Cloud offers Identity and Access Management (IAM), which lets you give
more granular access to specific Google Cloud resources and prevents unwanted
access to other resources. This page describes the Vertex AI Search for commerce IAM roles and permissions. For a detailed description of Google Cloud
IAM, see the
IAM documentation
.
Vertex AI Search for commerce provides a set of
predefined roles
designed
for quick control over access to your Vertex AI Search for commerce resources.
You can also create your own
custom roles
, if the predefined
roles don't provide the sets of permissions you need. The prior
basic roles (Editor, Viewer, and Owner) are also still available to you,
although they don't provide the same fine-grained control as the
Vertex AI Search for commerce roles. In particular, the basic roles provide
access to resources across Google Cloud rather than just for
Vertex AI Search for commerce. See the
basic roles
documentation for more information.
Predefined roles
The Vertex AI Search for commerce provides some predefined roles you can use to provide
finer-grained permissions to principals. The role you grant to a principal
controls what actions the principal can take. Principals can be individuals,
groups, or service accounts.
You can grant multiple roles to the same principal, and you can change the roles
granted to a principal at any time, provided you have the permissions to do so.
The broader roles include the more narrowly defined roles. For example, the
Retail Editor role includes all of the permissions of the Retail Viewer role,
along with the addition permissions of the Retail Editor role. Likewise, the
Retail Admin role includes all of the permissions of the Retail Editor role,
along with its additional permissions.
The basic roles (Owner, Editor, Viewer) provide permissions across
Google Cloud. The roles specific to Vertex AI Search for commerce provide only
Vertex AI Search for commerce permissions, except for the following Google Cloud
(Google Cloud) permissions, which are needed for general
Google Cloud usage:
resourcemanager.projects.get
resourcemanager.projects.list
serviceusage.services.list
serviceusage.services.get
The following table lists the predefined roles available for
Vertex AI Search for commerce, along with their Vertex AI Search for commerce permissions:
