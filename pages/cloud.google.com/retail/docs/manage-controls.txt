This feature is
        
        subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
        Terms
.
        
        Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
      
      For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions
.
You can export your serving controls to a file in a Cloud Storage bucket.
There are two reasons that you might want to export and import serving controls:
To move serving controls from one project to another.
To perform a bulk edit on all or some serving controls. Export the serving
controls, edit the exported file, and then import the file to change or add
serving controls.
You can export and import through the Search for commerce console.
When you export serving controls, you export all the serving controls in the
project.
To export serving controls, do the following:
Go to the
Controls
page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Controls page
On the
Serving controls
tab, click
Export controls
.
In the
Export Serving Controls
window, select the Cloud Storage bucket
to which you want to export the controls file.
Click
Export
.
The exported controls are saved to a NDJSON file in the selected bucket with
a name in the following format:
projects_
PROJECT_ID
_
TIMESTAMP
_exported_controls.ndjson
After the export operation completes, you can see the operation status in
the
Bulk import, export, delete activities
list in the
Export
activity
window. Open the
Export activity
window by clicking
Show
in the message window or by following the instructions in
See status for a
specific integration operation
.
Import serving controls
Preview
This feature is
        
        subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the
Service Specific
        Terms
.
        
        Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support.
      
      For more information, see the
launch stage descriptions
.
To add serving controls or modify existing ones in bulk, you can make your
changes in an exported controls file. You can then import them into
the original project or into a different
project.
Things to know about importing serving controls:
You can't import a serving control file if it contains both
search and recommendations serving controls.
When you import serving controls, all the serving controls in the file become
associated with the serving config that you specify on import. If a
serving control is already associated with another serving config in
the project, that association is also maintained.
To import serving controls, do the following:
Edit and review an exported serving control file and place the file in a
Cloud Storage bucket. (To export serving controls, see the preceding task
Export serving controls
.)
Ensure that the file contains only search serving controls or
only recommendations serving controls. You cannot import a
file that contains both types.
Go to the
Controls
page in the Search for commerce console.
Go to the Controls page
On the
Serving controls
tab, click
Import controls
.
In the
Import Serving Controls
window:
Browse and select the
Cloud Storage bucket and NDJSON file that contains the controls that you
want to import.
Select the serving config that you want to associate the imported serving
controls with.
Review the Import Preview plan. The controls that will be created are
displayed on the
New
tab and the controls that will be
modified are displayed on the
Modified
tab.
Click
Import
.
A long-running operation is started to import the new and modified
controls.
After the import operation completes, you can see the operation status in the
Controls
tab of the
Activity status
window. Open the
Activity
status
window by clicking
Show
in the message window or by following
the instructions in
See status for a specific integration operation
.
